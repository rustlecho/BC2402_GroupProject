The timing of main meals and the lighting/dimming of the cabin were done sensitively.

The B737 MAX is not fit for purpose for long haul flights and I would recommend that you do fly on this aircraft unless its for a flight duration of no more than 2 hours. Most passengers I spoke to by the end of the flight were also having back aches too.

Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean.  I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airline''s commitment to customer service. In retrospect, my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problem-solving from a reputed airline like Singapore Airlines was regrettably unmet. As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service, particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress.','Business','Feb-24','Singapore to Jakarta','Economy Class',5,4,5,5,3,4,'no','left me deeply disappointed',-0.375,'yes');

My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don???€???t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane???€???s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But they replied saying they can only give me a voucher to be used for my future bookings through Singapore airlines. I refused to accept it because I will not fly with them in the future.

Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane.

The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we won???€???t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesn???€???t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this interrogation happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldn???€???t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents'' actions without any understanding.

The service was feel more special on SIN to CGK sector though it was a very short flight. Definitely will choose this again (if the price is right, compare to middle eastern carriers).

The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class, the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable.

I believe since COVID they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers. It starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat. Bring back the old lounges! On the flights there are no hot towels. No newspapers. No nuts before dinner. No amenity kits. No mattresses.  Food is mediocre. The only thing that hasn???€???t changed is the first class cabin crew.

However, I was extremely disappointed with their service, especially the catering on board a 7hr flight from Brisbane to Singapore. The aircraft was a new A350, and I had a nice bulkhead seat which allowed me to stretch out. The inflight entertainment was quite good, and the redeeming factor for this flight. Unfortunately, the service and staff was mediocre, and not warm or approachable as I remembered. The food was just awful, especially for a medium haul flight, which consisted of meat and veggies just piled on top of gooey rice. Not even a salad or appetiser (which they used to serve), and a cold bun (there was an ice cream dessert). The washroom was filthy, wet and sticky floor, toilet paper in the sink, even just after the first hour or so, and clearly the crew did not pay much attention to cabin cleanliness (unlike other airlines, where I''ve seen crew inspect the facilities and do a bit of cleaning). Check in and baggage delivery was fine at the airport (but this may be as I have priority status).

The flight used a 78X and it was full of vacationers mostly families, and many of them may have not traveled by air before so it takes time to line everybody up for boarding. Boarding was done by zones and it was a good thing that boarding time was an hour before departure time, because ground staff had to weed out people lining up not in their boarding zone. The flight attendants were as usual with SQ, very nice courteous and polite, and very helpful even with the most clueless passengers. Soon we were all seated and left just 15 minutes behind. Service started as soon as the plane level off, and the FAs were very efficient yet friendly and communicative. One of them even gave us our second round of Singapore Sling without us asking, and we really appreciate him! For a short 2 hours flight the FAs were able to do two beverage service and a meal in between, and that must be quite a challenge for them! The meal offered are using their new sustainability concept, with paper containers and bamboo cutlery so they can be recycled. We found this an excellent proof that SQ is serious in their effort to go green and reducing use of non-biodegradable materials like plastics. The paper container is quite sturdy and even retains good heat for my Nasi Lemak. The portion was a bit smaller but the taste is just the same compared to past ones I had on SQ. The FAs on this SQ flight wears the mask at all times, as part of their company''s safety awareness effort.

Flights departed on time, cabin and toilets kept clean at all times. The 2nd issue of significance was that one of my 2 baggage items was nowhere to be seen upon arrival in BKK. This was at a time when all airlines were ramping up after covid and many were having issues with misplaced, lost or late baggage. In fairness to SQ, the item was "oversize"" and handled separately AND we had a tight connection of only 1 hour in SIN. It was reported to staff and next morning I received an email saying the smallish item had been located. I received a phone call and then another email updating me of the delayed baggage and that it would be delivered to my home 100km from BKK airport by courier - and it DID arrive as promised !.

Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn???€???t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast.

Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident.

Fine for passengers familiar with the system, but not acceptable for passengers who predate the automated era, and certainly not acceptable having paid for business class. Having finally checked in it was another disappointment to discover that Brisbane Airport has abolished fast track security. Obviously an airport decision but it begs the question, as a major user of Brisbane, have Singapore Airlines put any pressure on the airport to reintroduce this facility.

We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight.

The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its ???€???wine connoisseurs???€??? ???€??? but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years???€??? single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu?

The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid.

Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane, both of course, via Singapore. Both trips were ''busy'' business trips where everything needed to be on time and hassle-free. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet, including on one sector (Singapore-Brisbane) when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also, Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places, especially at Frankfurt - which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt.

Unfortunately, our excitement was totally crushed when we realized we can only board the plane in economy class upon check in online.

We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for.

I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn???€???t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn???€???t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice. Seating in Economy is good (always nice to have three of four legs with a free seat next to me), although one the A380 the seat angle was very far back - some people like that, I didn???€???t.

Users of Changi will know the security for flights at Changi is typically at the individual Departure Gate. Unlike at other airports where it tends to be before entering the Terminal. At Terminal 3 they''ve decided to do all the security for 4 gates, you are then in this little pig pen with 3 other flights, potentially 1500 people, it''s not big enough. The lines for the different flights cross each other, and there is little by way of organisation.

A cheerful and informative crew, attentive to people''s needs, even in Economy. The plane interior is pleasant, it was clean. The inflight entertainment was all right. OK, the food. Flight was at 00:30 hours, so there was no dinner, shortly after takeoff we went to lights out, with breakfast to be served 3 hours out of Melbourne. Meanwhile the hostesses came round on a regular basis with glasses of water. Breakfast arrived, lightly cooked sausages, scrambled egg, beans, and some nasty pasta tomato sauce, that smells of capsicum. The egg seemed to consist of only yoke, a small spoonful was enough to confirm it wasn''t fit for consumption. I''m a keen airline food eater, I enjoy the tray format, and I''m not too fussy, but this was inedible. I complained and asked for the alternative, vermicelli noodles with some stir fried chicken. It wasn''t great, too much vermicelli and not enough sauce, but it was adequate. An hour or so later, a senior hostess came and chatted with me, and asked me what was wrong, I described the egg, she said someone else had also complained, I thanked her for asking me. I had an extremely good Nasi Lemak going up to Bangkok from Singapore on January 8th with Scoot, so the Changi kitchens can produce good food, and needless to say Singapore is famous for its food. Please SQ, don''t serve food which doesn''t pass muster. At 5am Singapore Time most of us would be quite happy with a Continental breakfast.

The meals were also underwhelming compared to pre-pandemic with very basic options and accompaniments.

Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you''ll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a ''holding area'' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is don''t transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines.','Solo Leisure','Oct-21','Jakarta to London via Singapore','Business Class',4,4,4,5,1,1,'no','reduce both the level and quality of service',0,'no');

The company touted customers'' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn''t allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn''t have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates.  The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn''t need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense.

Wine was offered however only one red and one white, I don''t like Sauvignon Blanc and that was the only white. I did ask the flight attendant for a Chardonnay and she was very obliging and managed to find a glass for me. Big Plus! The flight was comfortable and the crew were outstanding. It makes a difference when the crew are customer-focused. Overall a good experience.

A few weeks in advance they changed several of my upcoming itineraries out of the blue with no offer of refund or compensation. One of the changed itineraries is a big change and really messed up my travel plans. First of all, I paid for a specific itinerary and they just decide to change it to an inferior itinerary. Secondly, I have a non-refundable domestic flight (not SIA) that I can no longer use with the new itinerary so I have to buy a new USD 100 ticket. So, I am USD 100 out of pocket. Customer service is non-existing with SIA. 3 weeks ago my domestic flight (not SIA) got re-scheduled and I arrived very early at MNL so I went to the SIA counter and asked if they could put me on the 2 hour earlier flight to Changi. My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight. I might think it is poor customer service but I acknowledge that they were in their full right to want to charge a change fee although it is in both our interest to increase my buffer time to reduce the risk of missing my connection.

It was quite okay at the first place, then the meal time came up. I struggled not to spill other''s passengers meal with my elbow because it was narrow. The entertainment system was really new. It had a lot of different options there and it was up to date. It was 5 hours 25 minutes flight. We just had one time meal and one snack time. It was okay tho. There were 2 options such as Korean or Western menus. I opted Korean one with the menu of Bibimbap. It was just okay since bibimbap was only vegetable and beef mixed with Korean condiments and. The cabin was clean and the most interesting of this aircraft that the window shades was electric by dimming the windows colour. It was nice! This was my first time flying with Boeing 787-10 and i still like A380 or A330 better compared to this aircraft.','Solo Leisure','Jan-20','Ho Chi Minh City to Los Angeles via Singapore','Economy Class',5,1,5,4,5,9,'yes','the legroom is pretty decent',0.20833333333333331,'no');

She delays the precious time of my travelmate by asking unnecessary documents as other ground staff does not require it. Another shocking part is the cleanliness situation of the cabin which was quite dirty and not up to SIA''s standard. There were coffee stains on the tray table and the cupholder of the seat. However, the cabin crew was responsive and quickly cleaned the stain for lunch.

I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn''t even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired.

The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy. Unfortunately it is economy class service, and through no fault of the crew lacks the extras expected in premium economy.

Leg from Sydney to Singapore the plane left on time, but what a disappointment the boarding process is, compared to Changi. The Boarding by Group No is a neat idea and works well at Changi, but Sydney is just the usual fare of Economy passengers standing in a massive queue trying to get on as quickly as possible and staff announcing the boarding by group, but not enforcing it. And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out. When I asked, I was told they didn???€???t have any. I think they just ran out of time. Love flying on the A380, spacious, calm and quiet, it???€???s a great experience. Got into Changi a few minutes early. Next day afternoon take off for FRA on 777. Food was sparse and mediocre but not bad. Just not quite the same standard and amounts as last year. The entertainment system has a big screen but the amount on offer is nowhere near Emirates standard and it is harder to find things/operate and the touchscreen is sometimes not as responsive as one would have liked. Crew again, very good and friendly. Lots of snacks available incl very fresh apples during meal times, the wines from Chile were excellent and the crew was always walking around with drink trays.

They took a long time (everyone else had finished eating) to find me some fish meal that wasn''t on the menu.  I was grateful. However, that nice gesture didn''t last for long. I literally opened my food to eat and the air hostess just dumps an ice cream (magnum) on my tray. Everyone else was happy to get theirs, but I had only begun (not even) eating! I had to gobble my food and eat the melting ice cream!  And on this very flight the air hostess serving me just took the cup in which there was apple juice remaining and poured me water. I also asked them for water when leaving the aircraft and they hesitated and made me stay the whole time until everyone left to get me the water (which was also a very small cup).

Boarding was on time and proceeded smoothly, with the usual warm welcome from the cabin crew. The seating and space is good, as expected in premium economy, with ample locker space. The seats include a leg support which is ineffective, and the footrest is not very good. There are no pre-flight drinks, unlike other airlines premium economy, and the water bottles had not been put out into the holders. This seems to be a hit and miss affair, sometimes the bottles in place on boarding, and other times only handed out later. Having water available immediately at least compensates to some degree for the lack of pre-take off drinks. Drinks were served with the meal shortly after take off, and again the Singapore attitude to premium economy is apparent. Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent. The primary justification for the premium price is space and comfort, which is provided, but having paid a not insignificant premium on the fare the expectation of an improved service level does not seem unreasonable. Overall the flight was good, with a superb crew, and it is unfortunate that SQ do not match other airlines with their premium economy service.','Couple Leisure','Oct-19','Seattle to Singapore','Premium Economy',5,5,4,4,4,8,'yes','do not seem to be committed to premium economy',0,'no');

This is probably the best thing about SingAir. Boarding is also a quick process. Most of the planes are a bit aged. Thus the screen or the audio jack may not work. The newer planes have better legroom. Although I always sneeze whenever I ride their planes, therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly. They try to have a variety of dishes, but if you ride SingAir frequently, you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same. I always like their salads. The crew do their job like clockwork, and that''s about it just like an automatic clock. No personalised service, no understanding the needs of the passengers. I''ve been to a lot of flights with SingAir and you may have 1 or 2 passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy, but the rest are understanding. Frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do, but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himself/herself to every patient under their care. That is the demand of the job. Lastly, it is very rare that SingAir flights are delayed, but in the rare occasions that they are, SingAir does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it. We don''t need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink. Other airlines do that, why can''t SingAir? Overall, SingAir is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey don''t offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays.','Solo Leisure','Sep-19','Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore','Economy Class',3,3,4,5,3,5,'yes','no personalised service',0,'no');

Probably my favourite are the little storage pockets you will find under the seat - one is shaped perfectly for your passport and phone, and the other for your boarding pass and immigration cards. However the WiFi is very overpriced, cannot believe that they are charging $20 for some 100MB of data- Scoot is cheaper at $18. Would also have liked to see some more new and blockbuster movies on the iFE, was a bit disappointed.','Solo Leisure','Aug-19','Singapore to Amsterdam','Economy Class',1,4,5,4,5,10,'yes','wonderful experience',1,'no');

On this occasion however we booked our tickets in business class and now that we attempt to select seats we are told we are unable to select the seat. The options are single seats spread around the cabin with no option to sit close to each other over a 12+ hour flight - that said we are still unable to book. We booked the tickets 10 months ago and I refuse to accept we were the last people to book this flight. We have contacted customer services to receive the answer seats are subject to availability. While I can accept that there are limitations on seating we are in advance of online check-in and were just checking available seats of which there are half a dozen dotted around the cabin.

A worry when I had all our passports etc in one of the bags as on take-off we could not have a bag near us and no seats to put it under. My major complaint is that as we were the first row after the Premium compartment and when meals etc were served they were served from the other end of the plane - we were last to be served. No offer of pre-dinner drinks (I had to get up and ask the crew after our meals were served). We had no choice in dinner we had what was left! Chicken! At breakfast the same happened all there was left was noodles and beef. I said to the crew I would like the scrambled egg please and he said it had all gone. I said I did not want noodles for breakfast so off he went and minutes later he brought scrambled egg dish. They forgot my husband and after 10 minutes they came with a breakfast meal. Why on earth do they give you a flash menu if they can''t serve you what you want? All in all a disappointing flight I always put Singapore Airlines in high regards but not this time.

There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal.

Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed glass amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints.

After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn???€???t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn???€???t possible (hello I???€???m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didn???€???t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didn???€???t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is Singapore???€???s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasn???€???t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. It???€???s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN. If going Australia to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers.

First flight with Singapore Airlines in Premium Economy and what a disappointment. It had little to differentiate it other than a little more space.

I asked how long that would be and was told 2 mins and then it was suggested I drink the plastic cup of water given. Very cheap and nasty especially considering there was no drink on boarding or pre-dinner. 15 mins or so later the drinks arrived by which time my meal was cold but on my request they reheated it (another wait). The red wine was awful. Throughout the flight the curtains to Economy remained open so that didn''t make you feel the extra expensive brought any benefit.

The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered '' book the cook'' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can''t sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot  Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one  showed up and asked me if I didn''t like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class.  Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip -  no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will ''take care of him'' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea.

Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I???€???m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her she said you can???€???t use these toilets you have to go back I explained the queue situation but she wouldn???€???t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it???€???s the only pram we have and we couldn???€???t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with.

It has to be said that the service provided in all four of the legs with Singapore Airlines was exceptional, from beginning to end (both on the ground and airborne); all staff where extremely professional, yet fun, friendly and accommodating to all passenger''s needs. This cabin crew in particular who looked after us on the long, SQ37 flight from LAX to SIN on 14/03/2019, provided beyond exceptional service. They were actively and consistently attending passenger''s requests, as well as checking that we were happy and well looked after, for what appeared to be the whole duration of the flight, or about 17+ hours. It was so satisfying and reassuring to see the dedication that this particular team had for their duties, as well as a clear love of the job. Great ambassadors for such well regarded airline such as SQ. We just simply couldn''t had hoped for a more enjoyable journey.

For my holiday to New Zealand in February / March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didn''t receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting / lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didn''t want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult / noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldn''t access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasn''t impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat / bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. I''ve had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider. I cant take the risk of paying for a business class fare and being placed on the A 380-800 again.','Solo Leisure','Mar-19','Singapore to Manila','Business Class',3,5,5,5,2,5,'yes','not very well designed',-0.1,'yes');

I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn''t allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don''t want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn''t have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn''t make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up. While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I can''t do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I don''t have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I can''t do that. They just didn''t want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I don''t know what is. Why can''t they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?  Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though.

Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken.

One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided. They said no, terms and conditions protect them.

In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good. We arrived in Singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout. During the flight, they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook, and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers.

Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing.

The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United''s experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight.

The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, caf?? or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure.

Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard.

Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it''s housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can.

Due to the timing only a light snack is offered. Although this was quick there was a long wait for coffee or drinks top up to be offered, and tables cleared, as there are no dedicated premium economy crew.

So I chose to repack my baggage since I think it is more expensive than I expected. after I repacked (1kg extra), the staff asked if I can pay for the extra or not (I was surprised, since it is just 1kg more). Even though I understand that the ground staff are mostly outsourced, they are representing SQ, so I should expect professional service. The aircraft from SIN to HKG was very old that the screen is still is squared format. The meal tasted bad as well. I do not normally complain about the quality of the food as long as they are acceptable, however, I did not think that it is in an acceptable quality from world No. 1 airline. Thirdly, I am not sure if all airlines are like this or not, however, from the meal menu, they have 3 courses to choose, I was informed that they only have 2 courses though. The seat of A380 is alright, but not okay for the B777 since it is way too old.

When I came back to Hong Kong a week later, I asked the ground crew at check-in if they might have any row of 3-seaters available,  ground crew looked to see if two rows that were blocked could be released. She then assigned the aisle seat, blocked the middle seat, and said she would do her best not to assign anyone to the window seat if possible.  I was able to lie down from London to Singapore. When they served the main meal, I told a flight attendant that I wanted Peppermint tea  and I brought my own as other airlines I have flown never had peppermint tea. He said they did.

But I didn''t wait too long until they started to work. Secondly, limited choice of meal. I seated at the back of the plane therefore I became the last person to be served in the flight. Due to limited in-flight meal with chicken, left me fish which I less like it. One cabin crew apologized tried to persuade me to accept the meal, but I appreciate another cabin crew tried to find any meal options including business class.','Solo Leisure','Sep-18','Singapore to Perth','Economy Class',3,5,2,4,5,9,'yes','still a pleasant journey',0.7333333333333334,'no');

Wine is of mediocre quality served in a plastic tumbler. Top ups are a long time in coming as there are no dedicated premium economy crew, and the same staff serve the economy cabin. Meals were the same as economy with extras such as tablecloths absent. The main reason for traveling premium economy is space and comfort, and we had a very comfortable flight and slept well.

The food on the menu was better than what I have had on most flights. The cabin crew were extremely polite and helpful. Our takeoff was slightly delayed due to issues with airport and I was afraid we will miss the connecting flight from Singapore. However, we were allowed to board the flight at Singapore even though we were 5 minutes late and the last passengers in! So they were basically waiting for us. I was very satisfied with the experience and I would love to fly again.','Couple Leisure','Dec-17','Taipei to Singapore','Economy Class',2,5,1,5,5,10,'yes','crew extremely polite and helpful',-0.125,'yes');

I booked the cook for all my flight meals when it was available. On none of the flights were any of the flight attendants aware that I had pre-ordered my meals.

They served me the preliminary stuff but then I sat for another hour with no meal served. I went up to one of the flight attendants, and she notified me that she accidentally gave my pre-ordered meal to someone else. However, 10 minutes later, she came out with my correct meal, which tells me she simply just forgot to serve me.

They refused to correct their mistakes and give me refund.  This is ridiculous! The service was not any better than United and I don''t even get the choice of meal that I want because they didn''t prepare enough (only 25% of the meal is fish).','Solo Leisure','Apr-18','Wellington to Singapore','Economy Class',3,3,2,5,1,1,'no','refused the airport lounge',0,'no');

We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: ''Safety first; we don''t compensate for delays or connections - if missed'' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn''t recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ.

Seats were comfortable, row 41, which has the advantage of lots of leg room but has fixed armrests which hems you in a bit. There is an extensive selection of movies which will keep most people entertained for a flight longer than the 11 hours we had. SQ is saving money a bit with the food portions getting smaller but flavour and quality were still there. A350 is quiet and the lower cabin preasure is noticeable in that you arrived refreshed even after the long flight, I even managed a few hours sleep. Flight departed a bit late but arrived 30 min ahead of schedule. Once again Singapore Airlines is a great way to fly.','Family Leisure','Feb-18','Johannesburg to Shanghai via Singapore','Economy Class',4,5,1,4,4,9,'yes','staff were friendly and professional',0.2375,'no');

I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each other???€???s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardess???€???s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasn???€???t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQ???€???s book the cook option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken.

I slept, but it wasn???€???t great. I wasn???€???t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals.

He probably didn''t act fast enough, somehow he stayed put. I didn''t feel like eating & kept the dessert (amazingly the attendant noticed, asked if the food didn''t meet my standard and if she could offer me something else. Wow! What airline does this!). I decided to sleep through the long flight. Feeling cold, I tucked myself in with blankets. The middle seat person apparently had to exit his seat numerous times. Instead of exiting from his right, where a gentleman was seated,who was not sleeping, was not working, was not tucked in, nor was he sleeping, he decided to pass through my seat. Each time, I had to re-tucked myself in. At one point, he dropped my dessert and spilled my left over white wine over me.

After checking in the clinic at T3 of Changi Airport, it was clear we couldn''t continue our route. Instead, our baby had to go to a Hospital in Singapore. Ground staff assistance was great, Both the employees of Changi Airport as well Singapore Airlines helped us in every aspect. They unloaded and stored our luggage, helped us with immigration and the transport to the hospital. Our baby was admitted in the Hospital. During those days, we had steady contact with SIA. They rebooked our flight 2 times (as the doctors couldn''t say for sure when our baby will be discharged) with no extra charge and being very supportive. As i understood, our price saver tickets gave them no obligation to do this for free - but to our great relief they did. They really gave us help and support in this hard time for us, showing us that even in todays world there is place for compassion. That there are times when paragraphs and formal rules are less important than the care for people in need and worry. We like to thank all the involved people from SIA and Changi Airport - you helped us when we needed it the most. Once our baby was healthy again and could be discharged, SIA helped us with our luggage and checkin in, making sure it all goes smooth.

The attentive crew made flying long haul by economy into a lovely experience. From Brisbane, the B777-200er plane was a bit dated, noisy and the seats were comparatively hard. Some seats have IFE boxes taking up some foot space, and the entertainment selection is more limited than the newer planes (e.g. No full box sets). However the crew service with hot towels, amenities packs and attention to detail more than made up for it. The first leg was late departing Brisbane, but without even having to ask, the staff on the ground assured us by announcement that we would make up time en route and sure enough, we did, even arriving early into Changi. This was a relief for me as I only had a 50 minute connection time. The plane change at Changi was easy and seamless. The second leg was on the B77-300er. I found this plane less quiet than the A380 alternative on this leg, but still very comfortable. The ambient lighting and temperature were pleasant. The crew kept the cabin spotless, regularly removing rubbish and cleaning the toilets.

I had a Boeing 777 on the way in and A380 on the way back, and, since that was my first travel with the A380, I''ll focus on this one. First of all, this plane is awesome! It''s so massive and  super silent. I paid for the extra space seat, which turns out to not be a super good idea. You paiy for more leg room but got an entertainment system in the armseat that is less pleasant than the normal, so, I''d say that''s not worth it. But, anyway, service was good, but not extraordinary. Food was not so good to be honest, I was a bit disappointed and the service was nice but, I didn''t find anything that stands out compare to any other big airline in my opinion. Seat was ok, I could sleep without too much discomfort, entertainment system was fine, no complaints about it. In the end, I had two nice flights, I really enjoy them but, I didn''t find that the Premium Economy in a 5 stars airline was much different that a 4 star one.

Both cabins were the new Business fit out and the seats (11K and 11A respectively) were of the new set up. The only issue is that I think there is a lack of storage space, and no drink tray (which is available on the A380) The A350 arrangement is newer of course and the individual cabin seems a bit smaller than those on the A380 and B777 (although the seat is the same width as on the B777). In reality the size seems to be on a good scale and uses the space well - it is very comfortable and all works well, and very roomy. Interestingly we were handed a small amenities kit on the Singapore to Barcelona flight - a first in my experience with SIA. The service on both flights was top notch and the attendants very friendly and attentive. The A350 flight seemed to be full, but the service was of a very high standard. We had a short stopover in Milan where we had to remain on the plane and there was a crew change. One of the flight attendants came up to say goodbye as she was leaving the plane. Very personal service. The A350 is a terrific plane - very quiet (much more so than the B777) and very smooth. I did feel better after this flight than other long haul flights so maybe the extra humidity and air pressure and better air conditioning worked. Meals and drinks were of a high standard and the toilet to passenger ratio seemed good. The only slightly negative thing was the Silver Kris lounge in Singapore - very crowded, and the showers are showing their age.

Being a frequent traveller with SAS I already asked to have my luggage checked through to Kuala Lumpur at Oslo airport, which was a very good choice as thus the SIngapore ground staff was prepared when the SK flight arrived in Hong Kong with a 80 minute delay. Despite I made it to the departure gate on my connection at last minute - exhausted after a long run through Hong Kong airport, the Singapore ground staff had already made a arrangement for me and my colleague to be booked on the next machine as the earlier flight had been anyway full. Both me and my colleague (who would not have made the connection as fast as me due to troubles at transfer security), we were both reassured, given new boarding passes and guided to the Singapore lounge for the next flight.

The legroom was large, the seats were decently comfortable and in-flight entertainment system was excellent. Before taking off, the crew handed out hot towels and the menu, which was very nice. Shortly after take-off, the service began with a smaller snack before the stop in Moscow. Here, all passengers had to get off the airplane, even if you continued to Singapore. Moscow was an annoying but thankfully short stop. Be prepared to show your passport/bording pass 4-5 times though, as there were several controls, and one proper security checkpoint. Nothing insufferable, but annoying nonetheless. After taking off again from Moscow, the rest of the trip was a breeze. The service from the crew was excellent, with food, beverages and complimentary items. It was a 10 hour flight but it went by quickly thanks to the wonderful seat back entertainment system. There were more movies than you could ever hope to watch during a flight, as well as games, tv-series, books and music, all of it free! The only thing you had to pay for was the wifi. As such, I didn''t check the cost, since I had enough free entertainment. As we began our descent the crew cleaned up nicely, and handed out the necessary immigration forms, if needed. The plane itself was only a few months old at the time and felt very modern. Everything looked stylish and clean. All in all, I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines economy class on this flight.

Our outbound leg was operated by a brand new A350. Despite the usually unremarkable ground service in CGK, we walked into the plane with high expectations, being known as a prestigious carrier here in Indonesia. Our previous flights with them has also been excellent. However, walking out of a Singapore Airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more. Sure, the A350 was an excellent aircraft in itself, with a spacious cabin, larger windows, high-tech LCDs for overhead signs and increased humidity, but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines. Seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests. Seat width was great, while pitch was nothing remarkable. Service was noticeably rushed, though crew were still professional, efficient and quite friendly. IFE was the most sophisticated and content-loaded I have ever experienced - complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller. However, it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information. And then the food came: every single portion of the meal was lackluster - very severely below industry standards. Also, the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight, at an ear-splitting volume - they rung at least once every thirty seconds. How incredible. What''s more, turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well, and when it was time to land, we hit the ground very hard. Kudos to the pilot. The return flight was operated by a 16-year old 777-300, a stark contrast to the brand new A350 of the previous flight. However, this was much better: food quality was raised to industry standards - good, but not great, service was friendlier, but still far from the best out there, seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests; the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence. But what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in Economy Class receives: the amount of legroom was mind blowing. I could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic. However, this flight also comes with its own share of flaws: crew service was not as efficient - they spent the first 20 minutes of cruise heating up food, and this caused my row to get the food only 30 minutes before arrival, and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent. Also, the IFE system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade. The screens were also falling apart as well.

Inattentive staff, cold food, broken in-flight entertainment equipment and terrible service.  I was with a friend when I boarded this flight and going back to Singapore after a semester of studies in Perth. We just had a rude encounter with a staff at the boarding gate and was hoping to get a warm welcome from fellow Singaporeans on the SIA flight. However we were received with hostile treatment from the cabin staff serving us on the flight. Had to pass through 5 flight attendants before we finally got an apple juice. First 2 attendants conveniently missed us when serving drinks to other passengers. The next 2 forgot our orders. Throughout these 5 encounters, we were received with rude attitudes which irritated, annoyed and angered us. It was a truly frustrating flight. A flight attendant also missed me when serving meals, had to be served by another from the other aisle. Apart from that, in-flight entertainment was faulty, didnt bother to announce before rebooting and after restarting. My remote had 1 button missing. Meals were not hot and rice was hard. I had previously tried Scoot for the first time from Singapore to Perth. Although the food was terrible, they provided a quality of service that could rival a full service airline and definitely beat the one provided by SQ on this particular flight.  Before this flight, I absolutely adored SQ. Now, I am seriously considering boycotting this airline for the treatment I received on flight. I seriously wonder if the old cabin crew who had built up such a wonderful reputation for SQ had moved on to serve in Scoot.  I don''t think any customer deserves to be put through the horrible treatment my friend and I received on this flight.

We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there''s a more generous luggage allowance. But that''s all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I''ve no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I''ve never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn''t offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn''t finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again.','Couple Leisure','Jun-17','Singapore to Munich','Premium Economy',4,5,4,5,1,2,'no','this flight was a terrible disappointment',-0.8,'yes');

We had the approval letter from the Vietnamese Immigration letter which was shown to them. The only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. This information was co-overrated by the Immigration department in Vietnam upon our arrival to HCMC. It is also important to note that this wasn''t our first time in Vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. What really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. It was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot, only having 10 minutes or so to do it. We almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. To make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. One of the staff members didn''t even bother to use the word please. How can these people work in the travel/tourism industry?

The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern; with other airlines (within Star Alliance) I usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with SIA. The food was good. Overall, if Singapore Airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline, it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience. The fare was not cheap (yet the booking class made it hard to earn miles outside of Krisflyer), and mediocre doesn''t justify a significant higher price than what the low cost competion offers.','Solo Leisure','May-17','Singapore to Denpasar','Economy Class',1,5,3,3,3,4,'no','improve the overall pleasantness',0,'no');

In general, Singapore Airlines was good, however, their service seems to be going downhill.  Dining experience was slow - the cabin crew on the other section of economy cabin even had finished their service completely while the cabin crew on my section had just finished halfway. Another thing was there was no consistency since the crew started from wrong direction. Usually they start their way form the front to the back but this time one section within the economy cabin started from the front and the other from the back. By the time they have reached my seat, they said there was no more choices so I had to take what was left. Furthermore, on the meal tray itself, my salad or appetiser food container had no cover.

It is a disappointing travel experience. The flight from Hong to Singapore (SQ871) was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived Singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. Yet my next flight from Singapore to Brisbane (SQ255) was going to depart in about 40 minutes. It was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time. A better arrangement would be appreciated as this pattern happens daily. As soon as I landed in Singapore, the staff informed me that my luggage could not get on the same flight as mine because of the time constraint and that I had to make a report after landing in Brisbane. However, no further detail was given and I was not sure where and who to talk to. The flight from Singapore to Brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between Singapore and Brisbane offices about my luggage. When I landed in Brisbane, I was directed to the office after asking a flight attendant and then the counter staff at departure. I would appreciate if I was given a better instruction in Singapore (or at least before landing) so that I would not need to run around in the airport. I told the lady at the office about my situation and showed her my flight tickets and passport. However, she did not check anything about my luggage and kept giving me confusing information. She told me my luggage should be in the baggage claim and I had to wait at the airport for an uncertain amount of time since I went through custom already and could not go back in anymore. Then she said the staff had paged me at baggage claim but I did not respond. However, I did not hear any announcement in baggage claim. When I asked her whether my luggage was in Brisbane or Singapore, she was not sure. I would???€???ve appreciated if she could check for me before saying anything.

Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didn''t see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative. I have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it, I do recommend Singapore Airlines.

I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQ''s crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passenger''s immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bin''s lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown. I can''t wait to experience the A350 on this route, and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated.','Solo Leisure','Feb-17','London to Singapore','Economy Class',5,5,1,5,4,10,'yes','generous seat width',0,'no');

Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs.

This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that''s something I haven''t seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen''t feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don''t think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment.','Solo Leisure','Jan-17','HND to SIN','Premium Economy',5,2,4,4,1,5,'yes','worth the extra  i dont think so',0.15,'no');

This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesn''t mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crew''s perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldn''t mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesn''t help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ. Cabin Wifi: The rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors. It didn''t also work for a good part of the journey. I am aware there are restricted zones but I have flown on the similar route with another competitor and haven''t had much issues with the Wifi.

Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level.  Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that.

We flew Air New Zealand to San Francisco in May and a technical fault in Sydney saw us trapped in the airport for 8 hours, miss our connection in Auckland and lose a day out of our trip. No-one should be blamed for technical problems but the rude and unprofessional manner in which ground staff at Sydney airport managed passenger enquiries was unparalleled in my 44 years of flying. We will never fly with Air New Zealand again. We will fly with Singapore Air.','Business','Nov-16','AKL to SIN','Economy Class',4,5,5,3,5,10,'yes','very impressive performance',1,'no');

Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there''s no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B''s already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one.

After a long discussion with the manager about how I''ve never had any trouble before and that it''d easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception.

I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I don''t feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyone''s flight be disrupted and stressful due to others'' selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone''s sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they don''t deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers. This was over 4 flights and I felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall.','Solo Leisure','Jul-16','BCN to GRU','Premium Economy',5,5,5,4,2,4,'no','i felt dissatisfied and disappointed',-0.75,'yes');

I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I''m also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if you''re very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I''ve had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars.

I don''t think it''s fair that they charge premium price for such an aged regional bird. Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife''s screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn''t the standard stowage space you''d expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg.

In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER''s are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good.

A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380''s primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines. Overall though I greatly enjoy taking this flight from Narita to LAX since the A380 is quite comfortable and less prone to the effects of turbulence.','Business','May-16','SYD to NRT via SIN','Business Class',5,5,4,5,5,8,'yes','treat passengers quite well',0,'no');

The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional.

I have sent all of the relevant documentation to support our claim for a refund. Our group of 3 booked adjoining Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck of an A380 from Doha to Perth after a connecting flight from Amman. We paid for our Exit Row seats on August 22 2023 and received email confirmation that day. What was a shock to us is that when we were at Amman airport we got our tickets for the second leg, from Doha to Perth, we saw that we had been seats on the lower deck. We said this was wrong and showed our August confirmation for seats 30 A, B and C on the upper deck. We were told by Qatar Airways staff in Amman that it could only be fixed up in Doha. We were also told that the reason was that the plane had been changed from an A380 (which was not correct) . Our connecting flight from Amman to Doha was not only cancelled but deleted altogether meaning we had a 10.5 hour transit instead of the original 2.5 hours. Then at the Boarding Gate in Amman we were informed that there were 2 Exit Row seats available in the Upper Deck and that these had been put on hold for us and to see the Qatar Ground staff in Doha. We were in a queue for almost an hour at the Qatar Service Desk in Doha. I asked how the seats we had booked and paid extra for in August, and provided emails and a hard copy to verify this, were no longer available for us? We were told that it was a system error. There was no apology at all for the system error. We were further disappointed to find out that the 2 Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck that we had been told by staff at the boarding Gate at Amman had been reserved were not actually retained for us and that only 1 Exit Row seat was available. Understandably we were not happy that we did not receive the Exit Row seats that we had booked and paid for more than 3 months prior. Through no fault of our own we were victims of a Qatar Airways system error. We did not complain to the flight attendants on the Doha to Perth flight as we understood that they had no control over the seat allocation. However, we politely asked the people in seats 30A and 30B, that we had paid for in August, when they had purchased their seats and were informed that they had done so about 2 weeks prior. I chose Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck because of the extra space and the cabin configuration of 2 by 4 by 2 seats and because my wife and I would be seated next to each other and the other member of our group would be in the next available Exit Row seat. Instead of all being seated next to each other in Exit Row seats we were split up and certainly didn???€???t get what we paid for. Plus all of the wasted time trying unsuccessfully in Amman and then at the Transit Desk in Doha to sort out the error created by Qatar Airways assigning our seats to someone else. It is bad enough that we didn???€???t get 2 of the Exit Row seats that we had paid for that were allocated to other people who booked well after us. What is worse is that there has been no attempt by Qatar Airways to address our complaint let alone issue the refund to which we are entitled.

This part of the flight is with American Airlines. American had no other flights leaving BWI for the rest of the day and I needed to get a connecting flight from Chicago to Doha. They only could offer a flight leaving the next nearest airport 40 miles away w/ no way to get there and it would also change my return flight to that same airport. This was not an option for me so I decided to make a last-minute decision to fly another airline that was flying out of BWI at a cost. I figured I could get refunded for that part of the flight from Qatar or even American - sadly not. American told me that Qatar would have to refund it. On the ground at the airport in CHI, it was a mess. It took an hour to get through check-in. While weather was bad, there were enough agents. Getting to the gate and waiting to board wasn''t a problem. I got an upgraded seat in economy class that had plenty of space. My return flight I picked the same seat and had another seatmate with an upgraded experience. Now between these two fights I''d say the first wasn''t as bad because the attendant also gave me my food right after my seatmate. Shouldn''t be an issue , since you have the cart of food right there. Why on the return flight I didn''t get my meal until the attendant came back after he went up to the front of the plane.

I was forced to pay for a transit visa, 150 USD, despite I was never on landside and had only 1 hour transit time. This scrupulous exploitation is unacceptable, just taking advantage of people in rush.

The good thing is that they, upon my request, at least reopened the check-in counter allowing me to check-in even after the minimum time of 60 minutes had elapsed.

Food and drinks were informed online prior to travel, which had raised my expectations.

Softdrinks numerous, but surprisingly, cava champagne was served as well as wine, spirits, and beers. Two catering service rounds in 55 minutes is impressive.

We left the lounge and used the general access / food court section and bought a decent glass of wine and better food.

Their rules state that I am unable to enter the Doha business lounge until a few hours before my flight, so the rest of the time, I would be locked out of the lounge.

However we were confused at the airport as it was our first journey through Geneva airport and did not attend to luggage. At the boarding gate only we realized that we were carrying huge bags with us. When we explained our situation to the Qatar air ways staff they calmly accepted the challenge and attended to our needs immediately without causing us any pain. We are grateful to all the ground staff and crew members at the gate 56 at 16.10 on the 2nd September for their concern. Even while serving us cabin crew members were polite to check on us to make sure that everything regarding our bags is OK.

We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was ''less than eight hours'' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am ''not a member'' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one.

This was the second sector of a flight from the UK. As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear.

I had some liquid items which I bought from Zagreb Airport, a Duty-free store.

The rest is nothing special. Even using my miles I would refrain to use them on 1st unless I had to forego them. Their excellent business class makes 1st class almost superfluous. The product is conservative, amazing space, and care level as the pax desires. QR markets their 1st class as a relish the myriad of exclusive offerings. Business class is similar (better?) and provides better value for the money. A single spoon of Pearl caviar doesn???€???t make it. The original can was displayed upon request. Sparkling wines in First are expensive, branded Rare and Alexandra (both ex. 2006), but Business has 2 fine champagnes, which are cheaper and good.  The interior of cabin is dull, conservative, with brownish un-inspirational colors. Access to Bar is fine but not only a 1st Class privilege. Tried to preselect food for weeks before flying but it does not work from my departing cities. Could not  access a menu in advance. Lounges, food, space, and service is better than business class. Welcome champagnes on board; given kit and a quality pyjamas. Champagnes served are truly expensive in contrast to the meagre, cheap, industrial sub-quality beers they could offer. Leffe was the least poor. On QR, I have never been able to get an IPA or porter beer. Food not much better than business class, a spoon of Pearl caviar and a deshelled, dry lobster hand does not make the justification nor significant difference.  Had hoped for some outstanding food, but it was close to ordinary. IFE fine big screen. Ground and Luggage: QR has ground handling problems. They refused to relabel my bags to final destination. Staff disregarded QR???€???s partnership with Rwandair, resulting me to lose my luggage transfer to final destination. Neither QR in Doha nor in BKK were willing to fix it. However, Rwandair fixed it eventually and opted to board me but leaving my bags 2 days behind in Doha before next flight to Kigali. Had to accept. Partnerships with Rwandair has problems of non-aligned systems, separate bookings, BPs not issued reversely, luggage transfer failures, no full lounge access reciprocality. BOOKING Very hard to come around vacant award seats in F, so I had to plan an entire journey around a leg found (BKK-DOH) to accommodate it. Award booking with QR took weeks to book, coordinate, manage, and process.

Better than BA first class in many ways. It lived up to expectations and was good news. The day before our return to the UK, received an email from Qatar saying another change of plane and no Q Suite. Could not delay flying back due to commitments. The seat was hard, lumpy and uncomfortable and did not properly go into flat bed position. The staff on board were hugely apologetic but there was nothing they could do. A pretty poor flight to Doha, where we then found the main business class lounge closed and everyone packed into another lounge.

I was very impressed with the alcohol selection - a sparkling wine (rare in economy class), quality red and white wine, two beers, and a small selection of spirits. Most impressive of all was the service: the crew were friendly, attentive, and polite. Drink runs were regular, and staff were engaging and highly professional. On one leg with few passengers, the staff were wonderful - constantly checking up on us, offering more drinks, proactively offering to make a festive cocktail (in economy class!), and ensuring our comfortable.

You may argue that the boarding in Doha was a but chaotic (bus transport to plane) but we all got on board without any hassle.

Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world''s best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.','Solo Leisure','Oct-22','Mumbai to Budapest via Doha','Economy Class',4,4,4,4,3,5,'no','experience fell short of my expectations',0,'no');

Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced.

The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren''t that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven''t used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn''t really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn''t work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity.

Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number. Also on the second flight, my booking was not visible at all.

This was a personal trip. While I have been to US several times over last 17 years - for business as well as personal trips, it was a first trip to US for my son. My son will be pursuing MS at USC in LA and hence he needed extra luggage allowance. My past experience with Qatar is the primary reason I booked our flights with Qatar, though it was not the cheapest option. I wanted to make sure that, even if I had to cancel my travel plan at last minute, my son will have hurdle free journey. However, I was happy that I chose Qatar Airways. Every stage - flight booking, seat & meal selection, check-in, in-flight exp, meals & snacks, in-flight entertainment, baggage handling - was a pleasant experience. Qatar provided extra luggage allowance as student allowance to my son. Qatar also provided full-flight complimentary wi-fi to him as a student offer. We are vegetarians. Almost all airlines have vegetarian meal option but a handful provide good quality and tasty veg meals. Qatar veg meal was excellent. So was their choice of snacks and beverages. Staff was polite and friendly though we were in Economy. I have noticed a stark difference in airline staff behavior when they deal with Business versus Economy class passengers. Even in Economy, their staff was cordial and caring. There were several passengers with variety of queries ranging from meal options to why satellite-based wi-fi was not working at certain times. Staff was answering and helping passengers with genuine interest. A couple of suggestions : 1) Qatar should consider waiving off seat selection fees for middle seats. I had to pay for it as I wanted to make sure I travel together with my son 2) I am not sure if Qatar provides confirmation notification about successful luggage transfer in connecting flights. If they don''t then they must consider providing this notification as it will serve as a huge relief for the passengers that their luggage is not left behind.

We requested for a ???€???Flight disruption letter???€??? to facilitate any possible travel insurance claim. The Manager told us that no flight disruption letter will be issued from Doha as the flight disruption had taken place outbound from Singapore. However, this was inconsistent with what passengers were told when the same request was made at the QR check-in counter in Singapore ie. to be provided at DOHA. In relation to our request for accommodation / lounge access, the Manager explained that due to COVID reasons, no accommodation nor lounge access could be arranged for affected passengers. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Qatar Airways, the least one would expect is for the airline to mitigate the inconvenience caused through other measures.

I could not be more wrong. They used an empty airbridge gate and used buses from there. The worst part was to sit in an very hot aircraft with an open door on the tarmac with a very weak aircondition.

Customer Service do not reply for 5 weeks and then refer me to the Privilege Club (of which I have been a member for 15 years). The Privilege Club refer me to the QR COVID policy on cancellation and then back to Customer Service. Whether a policy written by QR after the purchase of the ticket actually entitles QR to cancel my points is in my view moot. QR canceled the booking, then forfeited my points and gave me no notice of pending forfeiture (in Feb 2022). They restricted me to a two year window to rebook in circumstances where rebooking was infeasible due to COVID related travel restrictions. My point is why give a loyal customer the run around?

When we arrived at Heathrow we were informed our flight had only just departed Doha due to technical difficulties, which meant a 7 hour delay at the airport with 2 young children. We were offered a ????€?40 voucher for the whole family for food and refreshments. We effectively lost a day of our holiday. When we booked our tickets, we ensured we selected flights which had a brief (< 2 hour) stopover in Doha and we paid a premium compared to options with a far longer stopover. Shortly before our holiday we received a notification of a change of flights which meant we now had a 6 hour stopover in Doha for the return journey - something we had wanted to avoid with our 2 young children. I contacted Qatar by telephone (no easy task) to request an alternative flight but this was not possible and no explanation was given for the change. On arrival in Doha, the Qatar Airways transfer staff were unhelpful and not interested in providing us with any lounge access to allow our children to rest (we were in Doha airport from 10pm to 4am local time). We tried numerous lounges at Hamad International Aiport and were willing to pay for access but nobody was able to help us.  We tried to reserve premium seats on some of the flights via the Qatar app, but each time we were unable to complete the additional payment. I contacted Qatar by telephone to reserve our seats but was told I was not able to do this because I booked through an agent (Expedia). I contacted Expedia and was told I needed to contact the airline to reserve ???€???preferred???€??? seats. I contacted Qatar once more and spoke to a different associate who advised me that I could indeed reserve these seats after all. This whole process was convoluted and time consuming and a demonstration of the poor customer interface and lack of staff training.

Flights on time. Ticket purchase, upgrade by miles (2nd leg), ground services, ticket changes went smooth. I had to change a simple economy ticket 4 times. Only once I was charged additional (minimal charge). Check-in in CPH easy and quick getting all 3 boarding passes at once. This, despite I faced steep documentation requirements for final destination beyond Singapore to Papua New Guinea. Their cooperation with partner Air Niugini was perfectly coordinated and a relief. QR respect their elite members on ground as well as on board ???€??? for this trip there were no let-downs or real issues ???€??? their call centre was excellent, decisional, and cooperative. Lounge experiences: QR uses now the Eventyr Lounge in CPH which is a great improvement compared to the lounges they earlier used. Further, it is situated in non-Schengen area 3 Minutes from boarding gate. The Eventyr lounge is good, likely the best in Copenhagen - but it is still below world class. The best is the views, service, showers, and draught beer presence. Hot food only provides 1 dish while cold sandwiches are more diverse. No champagne and poor wines. They should open the balcony area to reduce greenhouse heating effect of the panorama windows which dominates the entire lounge. In Doha, the Al Mourjan Lounge is back to previous (pre-Corona) standards ???€??? lack of beer options are the biggest shortcoming. Good showers and very good relax/working options. CPH-DOH: I was given an exit seat but opted to take the only full seat section available next to the toilets so I could spread out with my things. Free WiFi for 1 hour granted, it worked well. Stewardess(es) were of high quality. Food good and are improving compared to just a few months ago. Sparkling wine (cava) offered in economy. The 2 wines were good. The new beers to replace the Heineken do not really provide improvements as they are also very dull, industrial lagers (Budwiser and Stella Artois). Arrived in Doha well pampered and in a splendid mood. DOH-SIN (night-flight) in business: Embarking in Doha at a remote gate by busses is a bad first impression for a business class ride. The Q-suites in business class are in my view completely overrated. These micro-cabins deprive passengers contact, air and view. Window access poor from those seats forward directed. If one sits backwards oriented, the window access is perfect but the direction is awkward to me. Seats and beds were excellent. The IFE is world class with updated movies, huge selection options, and the best I have ever encountered. Huge soft touch monitors. Smooth travel, reliable airline, flights on time. FAs excellent, 2 kinds: well-trained caretakers and less trained food-bringers. High class dining though without true dinner. The food was good but just light, cold dinner snacks. Cold lobster bites dont quite make it. Breakfast better, but merely neatly looking and served than actually tasty. Coffee and tea truly homemade and of high class. Drinks were World-class: 2 champagnes and 6 wines offered ???€??? all expensive and of high quality. Bollinger 2006 rose champagne was very tasty and sparkling one of the best I have had for long. One quality beer, Leffe Blonde, was outstanding. Pyjamas and Amenity kit given out.','Business','Mar-22','Copenhagen to Singapore via Doha','Economy Class',5,1,4,4,5,9,'yes','the ife is world class',0,'no');

I saved the receipts and submitted them to Qatar for reimbursement - and they will not reimburse me because I didn''t buy anything. Apparently if I had bought clothing when I was dead tired after close to 24 hours of travel, they might have reimbursed me.  But they didn''t tell me this up front.

After boarding was complete, the pilot made an announcement telling us that he cannot start engine number 2 and that technicians were on the way. He then proceeded to ask us to get off the plane because they needed to completely shut down and reboot the plane and that it would be very uncomfortable for us to be inside the aircraft when that was taking place.

I purchased extra legroom in the emergency exit row. When I reached my seat during boarding there was the pillow, blanket, amenity kit, and headphones on my seat. I set them down next to my seat on the floor, as there was no where else where I could have access to them while seated. For take off procedures the flight attendant grabbed all of the items and put them into the overhead storage bin away from my seat. When I was able to get up, I could not even locate all of the items. My food was average at best and staff took so long to collect the used meal trays that passengers were bringing their trays to the staff workstation. My one beef with the entertainment system was that they played the same airline/airport commercial every time you watched a new show. When time my flight arrived in Doha we had to exit using stairs and board a shuttle to reach the terminal. And with all of the other COVID rules on masks and cleaning, why would you pack in passengers on a shuttle bus until it is very full. I sent a fairly comprehensive email to Qatar Airways that highlighted my disappointment, received an automated reply from the airline nearly two weeks ago acknowledging receipt of my email but I have heard nothing back since. Perhaps it is the highly rated business class product that is generating the rave reviews.

Not enough seats, overcrowded, no social distancing. The rude and clearly incompetent gate agent shouted at his staff and contributed to the already stressful atmosphere. Priority boarding is a joke at the bus gates, as priority guests are allowed to enter the plane last. The plane was an oldish A332 with the very old narrow business class seats. Due to the uncomfortable seat, no sleep for me. Service was disappointing. I asked for just a glass of water and no food after takeoff and had to ask again 2 hours later because they forgot about it.

The entertainment system was alright but slightly laggy, and the headphones provided were awful. The food was of acceptable quality, though the lunch provided between the two meals was subpar (it was a boring, bland roll.)

When I became a member of their Student Privilege Club, I was surprised by the benefits they offered me, such as free WiFi and additional baggage. The flight from Kyiv to Montreal via Doha was my first flight with Qatar Airways, and I can say that I was satisfied (even though the journey was too long and tedious). Qatar Airways has excellent service (refreshing towels at the beginning of the flight), they offer nice food (and the good thing is the online menu so that you can make a choice before your flight). The food was tasty, and the portions are big (I think I spend half of my time aboard eating). On the 5h flight from Kyiv to Doha, they offered 2 meals + snacks, on the 12h flight from Doha to Montreal, I had 2 meals + sandwich + snacks. The seats are comfy, the legroom in the economy is okay (but for long flights, if you have money better to take a business class). In addition to the standard kit - pillow + blanket - they gave protective kits on both flights and amenity kit on a long flight (that was actually very useful for me since I always forget my eye mask and earplugs). Regarding entertainment, they offer many movies + as I mentioned there is WIFI aboard, but it was not working quite often. I had a layover in Doha for more than 10h at night.

The inflight meals were really good, I had three options to choose from both of my flights. On the Boston- Doha, they served 4 meals consisting of dinner, 2 hot snacks and 1 breakfast. The crew was really nice and friendly, they made sure everyone had a good time. Qatar airways also offers wifi where for 60 minutes every passenger gets it for free and if you want for your whole journey, you can pay 10$ which is a pretty cheap deal compared to Emirates that charges more.

We are glad that we chose Qatar Airways who made us feel safe and relieved. Transfer desk staff at Montreal were friendly and helpful in sorting out some last minute challenges on travel clearance. They gave us a meal voucher since all business class lounges were closed in Montreal airport. Boarding was streamlined to ensure social distance. Upon boarding the crew introduced and explained the cabin features. The amenity kid, COVID PPE kit, duvet were all ready at the seat and the crew offered the pyjamas. We chose the refreshing lemon mint signature drink prior to take off. The Qsuite is truly a first class business class suite with great comfort and privacy, could not ask for anything more. The couple suite rear facing was great offering us more personal space with the divider removed. The beverage and meal service was prompt and on demand. We miss the trolley service where you get to choose the options and appreciate the presentation but that is understandable during COVID times. One of the cabin crew was convincing my wife hard to have the breakfast since she skipped the dinner service. The crew wear their full PPE including gown and safety glasses and the passengers are required to wear masks at all times. The washrooms were kept clean at all times, however I felt the A350 washrooms bit smaller than the B777 ones. The transit experience in Hamad airport was smooth and refreshing. The 3 hours went by quick with shower facilities, spacious seating options and dining options on the upper level. The stand out was the consistency of care, genuinity and hospitality of the cabin crew - makes such a positive difference and validated our decision of choosing Qatar Airways especially during the challenging Covid times.

Their service, food and entertainment is amazing. However, this time I was perplexed by their services. I was leaving Najaf airport and the plane was late. I have notified the ground crew that I have a quick connecting flight and was nervous that I would miss my connecting flight. They reassured me that all will be well. We arrived into Doha and I missed my connecting flight. What happened next threw my experience into the negative zone. My next flight have been scheduled at 1855 hrs (18 hours later). The Qatar Airways staff told me that they did not have an hotel room left and he would offer me a complimentary meal voucher and I could find a place in the airport to lie down and relax. I told him that the meal voucher meant little to me since the delay in flight was their problem. If they could not arrange accommodation for me in the airport, the least they could do was upgrade my next flight. He asked me to wait as he spoke to his manager and 30 minutes later I was in a hotel room. The flight to Nairobi was amazing with great service and I cant complain about the air crew.

Boarding the aircraft at Bangkok was the most professional and well controlled that I have ever experienced at Bangkok''s Suvarnabhumi Airport; whereas they normally descend into chaos as soon as boarding is announced. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the modernity and cleanliness of the aircraft that we boarded, everything we needed for the flight, e.g. facemasks, hand cleanser, ear plugs etc were all neatly arranged in the seat pockets in front of us. The cabin crew were very smartly dressed and neatly turned out, and they were very polite, attentive and visibly present throughout the whole flight. The in-flight meals were of the very highest standard, and probably the best that I have ever been served on a flight back to the London. We arrived in Doha on schedule, and boarded flight at the correct time and the boarding was conducted with the same proficient manner as out first flight. The London bound plane was absolutely jammed pack, but the cabin crew, although extremely busy, behaved with the same quiet and firm professionalism that I had experienced throughout. I witnessed an incident whereby a passenger removed his facemask and refused to put it back on, this passenger was immediately dealt with in a very firm and thoroughly professional manner, which was very reassuring for other passengers around.

They are taking every reasonable step to make flying safe during covid, insisting on masks and on some routes, pre-flight testing. They also give face shields to every passenger at time of boarding, and implement social distancing. All of these measures help the passenger to feel safe and comfortable in the choice to travel at this time. Qatar Airways is a truly great airline that makes every trip with them enjoyable and something to look forward to.','Solo Leisure','Oct-20','Dhaka to Bermuda via New York','Economy Class',4,5,5,5,5,10,'yes','service is top notch',0.5,'no');

Now I rebooked my flight, again in Business Class, but the amount of my voucher was not enough, I had to pay also some extra costs. There is currently a promotion active which lets you earn many bonus miles - so I contacted Qatar if I will be able to collect these miles. The answer was no. You booked this flight with a voucher from an earlier, cancelled flight, so I am not eligible for the current promo.

My family advised me to call my cousin???€???s daughter who is an immigration officer in Kuala Lumpur. I was just about to call her when one of the gate agents called me back to the podium. Apparently, one of the Qatar Airways employee working that day thought outside the box, went online to the Malaysian website and printed out that letter for me. I filled out my particulars and signed it in front of her. She handed it to me and told me to hand it to the Malaysian authorities when I arrive. She then gave me back my documents and boarding passes and told me to have a nice flight!

We received a confirmation email from them with our eticket''s. I tried to contact Qatar Airways via phone at their listed airport number for two weeks to inquire and add our pet to our reservation.  Also tried reaching out on their facebook page but still no answer. We ended up leaving our pet behind. Upon arriving at the airport, the agent informed me that my husband''s credit card should be present for verification. I told them that I had the same credit card with the same account number/credit card number because we share the same account but my card is under my name. They refused it and were about to send me back home. The supervisor informed me that an email was sent to us for credit card verification. I informed them that I did not get such an email. I contacted my husband who was in the US and he also did not get an email. I quickly searched my junk mail and found that it was sent to me the day before the flight. I sat in the airport and submitted all required documents online (luckily I had all what they required available). We waited for QA customer support to verify but they did not. They tried to call them from the airport but they did not answer and they did not even reply to the emails they were sending. The supervisor then told me that the only option left was for me to put down another payment and once they finish the credit card verification, then they''d refund me. I used the same credit card and we were on our way. At Doha airport (transit) I seemed to remember leaving behind my expensive headphones hanging on the hand of my seat. I immediately asked a QA agent to have a staff member get it for me since i was not allowed back onto the plane. The agent called the lost and found office instead and got no answer. He assured me that they''d send it for me once found. I told him that I was still here at the airport and it would be quick to just get it now, he did not seem able to help. At Los Angeles airport, they seemed to have lost one of my luggage. The agents there assured me that all luggages were transferred and were onboard and another customer has grabbed my bag. I filed a missing bag form and they called me the next day to inform me that it was found. Upon inquiring where the bag was at, the agent told me that it was left behind in Beirut airport. Once I got home, I checked my credit card and found that the two charges for our airline tickets were both cleared. I emails customer support and until this moment did not receive my refund. I had to file a dispute with my credit card and since I had all proof that I was double charged, my credit card has immediately refunded my money back. They found my headphones and I have to drive to nearest airport to get them. Their inflight service is good, however not worth the headache they put me through.','Family Leisure','Aug-20','Beirut to Los Angeles via Doha','Economy Class',5,5,5,5,2,1,'no','informed them that i did not get such an email',0,'no');

Finally, we were able to get on a repatriation flight through Qatar airways. When we arrived to A,,an Airport, it was chaos, hundreds of people waiting outside the airport entrance to get in. This only added to the anxiety. However, once we got to the Qatar Airways check in, everything was very professional. We checked in online which sped up the process. Our baggage was several kgs overweight, so we needed to rearrange our packing. When we were doing this Khalil the duty manager came over and told us not to worry about the extra weight and he allowed it through. This was a lovely gesture and we were very grateful. The service before and when we got on the plane was top class. All the safety equipment was provided and the cabin crew were professional but at the same time friendly and warm, which is really important during these difficult times.
