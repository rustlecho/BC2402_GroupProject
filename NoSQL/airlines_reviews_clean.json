Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean.  I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airline's commitment to customer service. In retrospect, my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problem-solving from a reputed airline like Singapore Airlines was regrettably unmet. As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service, particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress.","TypeofTraveller":"Business","MonthFlown":"Feb-24","Route":"Singapore to Jakarta","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":4,"FoodnBeverages":5,"InflightEntertainment":5,"ValueForMoney":3,"OverallRating":4,"Recommended":"no","cleaned_review":"i embarked on a journey with high hopes and anticipation having secured a connecting flight ticket from penang to singapore and then onwards to jakarta opting for singapore airlines renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service i anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience the cost of this connecting flight amounted to myr  roughly usd  a price i was more than willing to pay for quality service my journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from penang the flight proceeded smoothly accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice as we approached changi airport the situation took an unexpected turn the captain announced a delay in landing estimating an additional  to  minutes before touchdown a sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer despite my concerns i remained optimistic trusting in the efficiency of singapore airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly upon landing at  pm and disembarking at  pm i was met with a startling realization rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight i was handed a new ticket rescheduled for departure at  pm accompanied by a sgd  food voucher for burger king and coffee bean  i sought clarity from the attendant only to be met with dismissiveness the absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed the disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airlines commitment to customer service in retrospect my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problemsolving from a reputed airline like singapore airlines was regrettably unmet as i reflect on this experience i am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress","polarity":-0.375,"complaints":"yes"}

My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn\u00c6\u2019??t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don\u00c6\u2019??t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane\u00c6\u2019??s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher.

As we travelled Premium Economy we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad. Premium Economy is very good especially the Leg room, which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane.

{"_id":"66b85f58c4a8d6813c87d8f4","Title":"Never again Singapore Airlines","Name":"Vibor Cilic","ReviewDate":"18\/11\/2023","Airline":"Singapore Airlines","Verified":"TRUE","Reviews":" We had the most horrific check-in experience with Singapore Airlines on Nov. 7th flight SQ 25 from JFK to Frankfurt. The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we won\u00c6\u2019??t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesn\u00c6\u2019??t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this interrogation happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their\/your client\/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldn\u00c6\u2019??t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700.

When they realized, they were wrong, they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and re-booking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent re-booked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and re-confirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their on-line booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in (2 days before flight), we discovered that one of our paid seats was re-assigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was re-assigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it.

The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat.

Cabin staff didn't seem very happy. Virtually had a bread roll thrown at me. Meal (only one on a 7-hour flight!) was not hot enough - cold in places - and tasteless. Bag drop at HND was a disgrace - the 'online check in' queue moved faster than the other one - with only two desks open it took 40 minutes. There seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online. The Singapore Airlines app is not very good either. SIN-LHR-SIN were better. Good cabin staff and service, and the food was hotter and better. Bag drop at LHR was smooth. Boarding well organized and smooth. The pilot explained a 'touch and go' landing at LHR well and there was no panic, but it did mean we were 20 minutes late - and we were already a little behind schedule. Singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check, which took quite a long time on the outward trip. I prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers. SIN-HND was better and the meals were quite good, as was the service. Plane was old, though. Booked the tickets eight months in advance, and they were never cheaper, yet they were only reasonable.

The flight used a 78X and it was full of vacationers mostly families, and many of them may have not traveled by air before so it takes time to line everybody up for boarding. Boarding was done by zones and it was a good thing that boarding time was an hour before departure time, because ground staff had to weed out people lining up not in their boarding zone. The flight attendants were as usual with SQ, very nice courteous and polite, and very helpful even with the most clueless passengers. Soon we were all seated and left just 15 minutes behind. Service started as soon as the plane level off, and the FAs were very efficient yet friendly and communicative. One of them even gave us our second round of Singapore Sling without us asking, and we really appreciate him! For a short 2 hours flight the FAs were able to do two beverage service and a meal in between, and that must be quite a challenge for them! The meal offered are using their new sustainability concept, with paper containers and bamboo cutlery so they can be recycled. We found this an excellent proof that SQ is serious in their effort to go green and reducing use of non-biodegradable materials like plastics. The paper container is quite sturdy and even retains good heat for my Nasi Lemak. The portion was a bit smaller but the taste is just the same compared to past ones I had on SQ. The FAs on this SQ flight wears the mask at all times, as part of their company's safety awareness effort.

Worse part when the stroller was return it was damaged. On our return flight April 15 FRA - KUL We found out that our original seats which was bassinet seats were changed and we had to go to the airport early to make sure that my baby has a bassinet. This was very frustrating for us with a 1yr old baby. We were also ask to check in at the gate another bag that contains my baby items as it was too big to go into the overhead cabin as per the crew.

I received a call from SQ a day prior to departure requesting a voluntary downgrade due to last minute aircraft change and not having enough business class seats. I was told that I would receive S$ 200 plus a same sector upgrade voucher. I agreed and I was told that I would receive an email shortly with the details; which was never sent. Upon check-in, I was told that it was an error, that I would receive either the cash or the voucher. I opted for the cash, since I had no use for the sector upgrade. At the gate, I received a letter that there would be a fare difference compensation, which, in my case exceeded the S$ 200. After having three compensation versions, I approached the purser of the flight who told me that the payment would be $200 and another $ 200. (Version number 4). She also told me that she would mention my case in n her flight report and asked for my email address. She told me that I would be contacted shortly, which never happened. I also wrote in to SQ with no response received. I am not trying to get something out of this, but I do not appreciate being treated like a fool. The flight itself was rather mediocre with SQs new concept of tiny portions in a cardboard box, which does not work for me.

Both flights were the morning A380 flights in Premium Economy. So we\u00c6\u2019??ve had best part of 27 hours experiencing the Premium Economy product. Boarding for both flights was painless. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early. The premium economy cabin on the A380 is right at the front and as such feels quite exclusive. Indeed there are only about 40 seats in the cabin in a 2-4-2 configuration. To keep this review brief. The seats were a major upgrade on the usual economy seats both in comfort and space. The food was lovely - we used Book the Cook for all our meals. Plenty of drinks brought around and if you needed a top up or a snack this was provided promptly. Again on both flights the cabin crew were amazingly good. We paid about ?\u00c5\u201c600 each extra over and above the economy fare, which at the time of booking meant our premium economy fare was double the economy fare. So an extra ?\u00c5\u201c300 each way to be in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Well yes it is , but I add a proviso. It\u00c6\u2019??s worth paying extra, as long as the extra you pay is no more than around ?\u00c5\u201c600-?\u00c5\u201c700 for long haul return. ?\u00c5\u201c600 economy vs ?\u00c5\u201c1200 Premium, that a no brainer.

Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate\/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadn\u00c6\u2019??t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident.

Fine for passengers familiar with the system, but not acceptable for passengers who predate the automated era, and certainly not acceptable having paid for business class. Having finally checked in it was another disappointment to discover that Brisbane Airport has abolished fast track security. Obviously an airport decision but it begs the question, as a major user of Brisbane, have Singapore Airlines put any pressure on the airport to reintroduce this facility.

When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters seat was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesn't remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying air freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would.

Pre take off drinks were offered, but only fruit juice and water, no champagne. No amenity kits offered except by request. Food and drink orders were taken immediately after take off, and serve with sosatie appetisers. Meals were served not long after with a varied choice of mains. Book the Cook is not available ex Johannesburg, and also whilst it is possible to preview the menu, it is not possible to order. Not a problem for us, as we were near the front. Decent wines were on offer, although a somewhat limited choice. Food was good, as was the service. The seat is very comfortable and notably wider than most. Flor sleeping it is necessary to fold down the backrest to create the bed, which is easily done, although attendants were quick to help. The drawback to the bed is a small cubbyhole for the feet offset from the bed, although in use this was not a particular problem, and wwe both slept for most of the flight. Breakfast was offered as and when people woke, and arrival in Singapore on time. As usual immigration was a breeze.

No warm welcome back  by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canap??s I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own \u00c6\u2019?? another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its \u00c6\u2019??wine connoisseurs\u00c6\u2019?? \u00c6\u2019?? but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 years\u00c6\u2019?? single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesn\u00c6\u2019??t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers,  I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid.

Singapore Airlines travel was Brisbane to Munich and Frankfurt to Brisbane, both of course, via Singapore. Both trips were 'busy' business trips where everything needed to be on time and hassle-free. Singapore Airlines exuded high quality personal service. Aircraft were spotless and cabins quiet, including on one sector (Singapore-Brisbane) when a number of babies turned up. Disappointing was the food and wine including the choices available. Emirates was far better in this category. Also, Singapore Airlines had no hot towels or printed menus. Maybe this was due to recent COVID issues but the comparison with Emirates was stark. Also Lounge access and quality was very poor. The Silver Kris Lounge in Singapore at midnight resembled a packed works canteen on a bad day. Boarding was quite chaotic at a number of places, especially at Frankfurt - which often seems to be the case for these Singapore Airlines A380 flights out of Frankfurt.

We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund\/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for. However, they claim it is not their fault and is refusing any refunds.

I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn\u00c6\u2019??t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn\u00c6\u2019??t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice.

Singapore to Melbourne flight, SQ237. Seated in 63H, towards the back. The flight was full, the first day the Australian border was open. The boarding procedure at Changi Airport Terminal 3. Users of Changi will know the security for flights at Changi is typically at the individual Departure Gate. Unlike at other airports where it tends to be before entering the Terminal. At Terminal 3 they've decided to do all the security for 4 gates, you are then in this little pig pen with 3 other flights, potentially 1500 people, it's not big enough. The lines for the different flights cross each other, and there is little by way of organisation. No one seemed to be in charge, when I politely mentioned it didn't seem very organised I was met with a blank stare. I didn't expect this at Changi Airport. A cheerful and informative crew, attentive to people's needs, even in Economy. The plane interior is pleasant, it was clean. The inflight entertainment was all right. OK, the food. Flight was at 00:30 hours, so there was no dinner, shortly after takeoff we went to lights out, with breakfast to be served 3 hours out of Melbourne. Meanwhile the hostesses came round on a regular basis with glasses of water. Breakfast arrived, lightly cooked sausages, scrambled egg, beans, and some nasty pasta tomato sauce, that smells of capsicum. The egg seemed to consist of only yoke, a small spoonful was enough to confirm it wasn't fit for consumption. I'm a keen airline food eater, I enjoy the tray format, and I'm not too fussy, but this was inedible. I complained and asked for the alternative, vermicelli noodles with some stir fried chicken.

Singapore and Singapore \u00c6\u2019?? Melbourne have completely turned me off Singapore Airlines. Their new fit outs of their A350s have reduced the seat pitch and the seats are a step back in quality. The cushioning is very thin and hard which is uncomfortable and the seats themselves are poorly constructed. The seat in front of me would buckle and bend every time the average size person in it moved which meant my knees copped a pounding given they were crammed up against the seat because of the reduction in space.  These new seats negate SIA from being a feasible selection as an airline for me. Thankfully the plane from Singapore to Manchester had not suffered the same upgrade and was a reminder of how bad the Melbourne \u00c6\u2019?? Singapore update is.  The meals were also underwhelming compared to pre-pandemic with very basic options and accompaniments. It took them 3 hours after take off to provide food and remove the trays due to having only one trolley cart servicing each aisle in the economy cabin. The whole experience very much smacked of an airline that has been taken over by bean-counters and they are cutting costs at every turn possible with cramming more people on the plane and providing less food and staff, and ultimately an experience that is a shade of SIA's glory days pre-pandemic.","TypeofTraveller":"Couple Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jan-22","Route":"Melbourne to Manchester via Singapore","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":1,"InflightEntertainment":3,"ValueForMoney":2,"OverallRating":3,"Recommended":"no","cleaned_review":"ive got to say that my experience flying melbourne  singapore and singapore  melbourne have completely turned me off singapore airlines their new fit outs of their as have reduced the seat pitch and the seats are a step back in quality the cushioning is very thin and hard which is uncomfortable and the seats themselves are poorly constructed the seat in front of me would buckle and bend every time the average size person in it moved which meant my knees copped a pounding given they were crammed up against the seat because of the reduction in space  these new seats negate sia from being a feasible selection as an airline for me thankfully the plane from singapore to manchester had not suffered the same upgrade and was a reminder of how bad the melbourne  singapore update is  the meals were also underwhelming compared to prepandemic with very basic options and accompaniments it took them  hours after take off to provide food and remove the trays due to having only one trolley cart servicing each aisle in the economy cabin the whole experience very much smacked of an airline that has been taken over by beancounters and they are cutting costs at every turn possible with cramming more people on the plane and providing less food and staff and ultimately an experience that is a shade of sias glory days prepandemic","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches\/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light\/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched.

The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates.  The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense.

They weighed the personal bag and made fuss about the weight being 0.2 kgs over in one bag while it was 0.3 kgs under in another bag.

Customer service is non-existing with SIA. 3 weeks ago my domestic flight (not SIA) got re-scheduled and I arrived very early at MNL so I went to the SIA counter and asked if they could put me on the 2 hour earlier flight to Changi. My flight from Changi to Europe would be the same. So, I would have a 5 hour lay-over in Changi instead of 3 hours. SIA replied that they could do that but asked me to pay a change fee. I declined and took my original flight. I might think it is poor customer service but I acknowledge that they were in their full right to want to charge a change fee although it is in both our interest to increase my buffer time to reduce the risk of missing my connection. However, now that they changed my next itineraries I don't hear them talking about them paying a change fee to me. It is not OK to change and provide an inferior itinerary for the same price for any customer.

Same thing happened when I logged -in under my wife's name - the cabin crew was helpless and could not help. I was told to pay to get wifi , which of-course I did not. The cabin crew were fantastic and did their best to make us feel happy but there was only so much they could do.

Odd thing cabin crew never heard of it and 3 days later from SIN-MUC there were no issues with it being taken as hand luggage. Flight boarded late due to a late arrival but some of the time was made up with a near on time arrival. The 787 has a tighter configuration than the A350 regional configuration.

Until now I have been very happy with SQ and have always preferred it above Cathay Pacific (hence the extra 4 hours in taking these flights instead of the direct flights) The flight was great and nothing to complain .. as a cardholder I had access to the lounge and SQ has been always great in accepting my kids (younger then 12yrs) with me in their lounges. Upon arrival in Hong Kong I discovered that one of my suitcases was damaged (zipper was damaged and could not be used anymore)\/I went straight to their handling agent and was offered 3 options: 1) they could provide me with a report for my travel insurance, 2) They could try to fix it or 3) I was offered 500 HKD (50 Euro) as compensation. I argued with them that they destroyed the luggage so why should my insurance pay for their damaged caused, also the 500HKD would never cover a new suitcase (bought a year ago) so I asked to see somebody from Singapore airlines .. a girl appeared and immediately the same offer was made but the amount got up to 800HKD .. I argued that the money wouldn't even cover a new one. So she agreed to have my luggage picked up from my place in Hkg and tried to have it repaired.

The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy. Unfortunately it is economy class service, and through no fault of the crew lacks the extras expected in premium economy.

And the overhead screens showed Group 4 non-stop whilst they boarded other groups, whatever. Service on board was warm and welcoming, food was good but, surprisingly, even though it was announced, no immigration cards were handed out.

Eyemask upon request. Nice pitch, calf support and generous recline for Economy.

Food is the same as economy served on plastic trays, with no linen or crockery. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers. SQ advertise champagne available throughout the flight, and serve a good quality champagne, but in a tiny plastic tumbler. Service starts in premium economy, but the same crew carry on through economy, and trays remain until service is complete, and no drink refills are offered in the meantime. Water bottles were eventually handed out after meal service. Singapore economy class service is probably the best in the world, and on this flight the crew were superb. Unfortunately they do not seem to be committed to premium economy, and the enhancements which are provided by their competitors are absent.

This is probably the best thing about SingAir. Boarding is also a quick process. Most of the planes are a bit aged. Thus the screen or the audio jack may not work. The newer planes have better legroom. Although I always sneeze whenever I ride their planes, therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly. They try to have a variety of dishes, but if you ride SingAir frequently, you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same. I always like their salads. The crew do their job like clockwork, and that's about it just like an automatic clock. No personalised service, no understanding the needs of the passengers. I've been to a lot of flights with SingAir and you may have 1 or 2 passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy, but the rest are understanding. Frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do, but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himself\/herself to every patient under their care. That is the demand of the job. Lastly, it is very rare that SingAir flights are delayed, but in the rare occasions that they are, SingAir does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it. We don't need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink. Other airlines do that, why can't SingAir? Overall, SingAir is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey don't offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Sep-19","Route":"Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":3,"StaffService":3,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":5,"ValueForMoney":3,"OverallRating":5,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"the checkin process is always a breeze this is probably the best thing about singair boarding is also a quick process most of the planes are a bit aged thus the screen or the audio jack may not work the newer planes have better legroom although i always sneeze whenever i ride their planes therefore the seats may not be disinfected regularly they try to have a variety of dishes but if you ride singair frequently you will notice that the names of the dishes may change but the taste is just the same i always like their salads the crew do their job like clockwork and thats about it just like an automatic clock no personalised service no understanding the needs of the passengers ive been to a lot of flights with singair and you may have  or  passengers who can be a bit demanding and needy but the rest are understanding frequent flyers know that they have a hundred and million things to do but being an attendant is like a profession just like being a doctor who commits himselfherself to every patient under their care that is the demand of the job lastly it is very rare that singair flights are delayed but in the rare occasions that they are singair does not offer provisions for passengers who are inconvenienced by it we dont need fancy hotels but maybe a space where we can relax other than the airport chairs or offer a massage or offer a meal or drink other airlines do that why cant singair overall singair is still a good airline if you are not very particular about things like the attendants being sensitive and aware that passengers are people that they should be taking care of or that the food tastes the same even though the names are different or hey dont offer anything to passengers who are inconvenienced with the delays","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

Once entering aircraft was greeted by friendly cabin crew who showed me to my seat, came around and gave me headphones and eye shades. With my status, I was given a whole row to myself and the crew gave me business-class quality hot towel and headphones. The aircraft, being 15 days old at the time of flying, had a fast touchscreen monitor. The toilets were stocked with free amenities, including toothbrush and toothpaste. Crew took my order first, food choices sweet and sour pork or steamed fish. I chose the pork, was so delicious.  Delicious Turkish pide, couscous salad, and bread roll. I was also given an activity pack (although really not for my age still a nice touch), which featured a deck of cards and some crayons. KrisWorld lounge was a bit crowded even at midnight, with a stream of people waiting to connect.  The seat was plush and featured adjustable headrest, footrest and much more. Probably my favourite are the little storage pockets you will find under the seat - one is shaped perfectly for your passport and phone, and the other for your boarding pass and immigration cards. However the WiFi is very overpriced, cannot believe that they are charging $20 for some 100MB of data- Scoot is cheaper at $18.

The seats were bulkhead and were okay. However, I have a complaint about passengers bringing on too much luggage as they call these seats last when you get on the plane. All the overhead lockers are full of other passengers bags - we had to put our luggage at least 6 compartments down from where we were sitting. A worry when I had all our passports etc in one of the bags as on take-off we could not have a bag near us and no seats to put it under. My major complaint is that as we were the first row after the Premium compartment and when meals etc were served they were served from the other end of the plane - we were last to be served. No offer of pre-dinner drinks (I had to get up and ask the crew after our meals were served). We had no choice in dinner we had what was left! Chicken! At breakfast the same happened all there was left was noodles and beef. I said to the crew I would like the scrambled egg please and he said it had all gone. I said I did not want noodles for breakfast so off he went and minutes later he brought scrambled egg dish. They forgot my husband and after 10 minutes they came with a breakfast meal. Why on earth do they give you a flash menu if they can't serve you what you want? All in all a disappointing flight I always put Singapore Airlines in high regards but not this time.

{"_id":"66b85f58c4a8d6813c87da68","Title":"there is nothing premium about the service","Name":"Ken Howie","ReviewDate":"19\/8\/2019","Airline":"Singapore Airlines","Verified":"TRUE","Reviews":" Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight. Priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in, with ample space in the overhead lockers. Just three rows in the cabin, with good legroom and comfortable seats, which have a decent recline. There is a footrest on the seat in front, and a calf rest attached to the seat, which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing. Good sized TV screen which is easy to operate. Overall the hard product is good. However there is nothing premium about the service, which is strictly economy. There are no pre take-off drinks, and there was no bar service after take-off prior to the meal. This may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible, but one would have thought that with a maximum of 24 in premium economy this would not have been a big issue. Amenity kits are no longer handed out, but the menu indicated they were available on request. Meals were tasty, but the same as economy, served on plastic trays. No sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website. Drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses, and in small quantities. Wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled. Fruit juice slightly larger serving, but still meagre. No offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed. There are no dedicated crew in premium economy. Service starts with premium, but then proceeds through economy, with clearing starting at the back of economy, so that premium economy is the last to be cleared. With the time difference the second meal was lunch. This time I ordered champagne, served in a plastic stemmed glass amounting to half a normal glass, again no refills offered until trays cleared, at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly. The main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort, on which there are no complaints. However notwithstanding the fact that Singapore economy is amongst the best, it is not a premium economy service. Having chosen to pay a significant premium over economy, it is disappointing that the enhancements provided by other airlines are not provided.","TypeofTraveller":"Couple Leisure","MonthFlown":"Aug-19","Route":"Singapore to Canberra via Sydney","Class":"Premium Economy","SeatComfort":4,"StaffService":4,"FoodnBeverages":5,"InflightEntertainment":5,"ValueForMoney":4,"OverallRating":7,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"johannesburg to singapore in premium economy on the recently introduced second flight priority boarding after business class allows time to settle in with ample space in the overhead lockers just three rows in the cabin with good legroom and comfortable seats which have a decent recline there is a footrest on the seat in front and a calf rest attached to the seat which seems to serve no purpose other than create problems for the crew in trying to them stowed for landing good sized tv screen which is easy to operate overall the hard product is good however there is nothing premium about the service which is strictly economy there are no pre takeoff drinks and there was no bar service after takeoff prior to the meal this may have been due to the late hours departure and a wish to serve the meal as quickly as possible but one would have thought that with a maximum of  in premium economy this would not have been a big issue amenity kits are no longer handed out but the menu indicated they were available on request meals were tasty but the same as economy served on plastic trays no sign of table cloths and proper crockery as shown on the website drinks are served in plastic as opposed to glasses and in small quantities wine was a basic white or red in a small plastic tumbler half filled fruit juice slightly larger serving but still meagre no offers of refills until the trays were eventually removed there are no dedicated crew in premium economy service starts with premium but then proceeds through economy with clearing starting at the back of economy so that premium economy is the last to be cleared with the time difference the second meal was lunch this time i ordered champagne served in a plastic stemmed glass amounting to half a normal glass again no refills offered until trays cleared at which time the champagne had disappeared from the trolly the main reason for choosing premium economy is space and comfort on which there are no complaints however notwithstanding the fact that singapore economy is amongst the best it is not a premium economy service having chosen to pay a significant premium over economy it is disappointing that the enhancements provided by other airlines are not provided","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

In the past 10 year or so, we can clearly see many once premium airlines in the world have to resort to cost cutting, due to keen competition from low cost carriers and many other factors. Haven't not been on economy class of Singapore for quite some time, I decided to try it for it's a short haul flight plus it's price factor was very good this time. The usual high standard of SIA is there with the immaculately groomed kebaya-clad crew, and the good condition of the plane and its amenities etc. Hot towel service is still provided in economy class which is a nice touch. Menu is not given since it's a short sector. Hot drinks, cold beverages and meals are all served in one go, which cuts time and makes good sense. However, one can clearly see some cost cutting with the portion of the meal smaller, and the taste was rather bland and mediocre. Boeing 787 on the way to BKK was a fine plane, except the seat pitch and the aisle are all very narrow. Sat at the aisle, I was constantly bumped by the crew and passengers, there's almost nowhere foe me to hide as I wild be spilling onto my neighbour's space. It's quite frustrating really. Also the tray table is so close to my stomach, it's uncomfortable to say the least. Touch screen AVOD was very good, and pre-ordered duty free was dully delivered without delay. On return, SIA has a good lounge on concourse D of BKK airport, which is very close to the boarding gate, D6 or 7. A330, despite being an older plane, actually offered more seat pitch and slightly more space. No touch screen this time. The catering from BKK was better than from SIN.

After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasn\u00c6\u2019??t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasn\u00c6\u2019??t possible (hello I\u00c6\u2019??m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didn\u00c6\u2019??t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didn\u00c6\u2019??t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is Singapore\u00c6\u2019??s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasn\u00c6\u2019??t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. It\u00c6\u2019??s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN.

As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really?

On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system.

We had really been looking forward to the new A359 taking over from the old 777 on the Christchurch to Singapore route with the choice of premium economy. Unfortunately, the bean counters seem to have designed the cabin! The configuration is 2x4x2 \u00c6\u2019?? just one seat less than economy \u00c6\u2019?? compared with 2x3x2 for Lufthansa in premium economy in the same type of aircraft, which we enjoyed for the next leg of our trip to Europe. The lavatories are the size of a small cupboard and there is no space to get up and stretch your legs in the cabin, unlike earlier aircraft. Going over was OK in the two seats by the window, but as others have pointed out, the central armrest and padded seatbelt (it contains an airbag) intrude on space. Inflight food and service was fine, if not memorable. Coming back overnight stuck in the middle seats was a lot worse. Space feels very tight. Not all menu choices were available, and we got beef mince, which was not very good at all. We asked for eggs for breakfast but got yam cake. A gentleman two seats along turned on his overhead lamp at about 3:00 am (he should have used the reading lamp). No eyeshades or earplugs provided. We asked for some but still got no sleep. Screens didn't work for two of the passengers in front of us. This flight ended up being diverted because of fog, adding six hours to the nine hour flight (of course, not SIA\u00c6\u2019??s fault) but the whole experience was very tiring. One other thing: Electronic check-in at Changi was confusing and everyone had to ask what step to do next. It should be much clearer. We have flown with SIA for 35 years and feel they are trading on their past good reputation and really need to lift their game. Premium economy on SIA really isn\u00c6\u2019??t worth the extra cost.

{"_id":"66b85f58c4a8d6813c87da9b","Title":"really felt disappointment","Name":"Zvi Rosen","ReviewDate":"22\/4\/2019","Airline":"Singapore Airlines","Verified":"TRUE","Reviews":"  My son and I flew Business class Singapore to Shanghai in April. The Business lounge in Changi is OK, but nothing to write home about. We ordered ' book the cook' option, one chicken Brest and one Steak dish. Upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew, the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list. The seat was incredibly wide,but quite hard in my opinion. My tail bone tells me immediately, as I was injured in a ski accident, and I can't sit in a regular economy seat more than 2 hours. I was a bit disappointed, as Aeroflot  Business seat from Moscow to Shanghai was much softer and pampering. After take off I went to the bathroom, and upon my return I found the satay dish awaiting me. I only enjoyed the chicken stick. Then no service for almost 45 min, without one cabin staff in sight .Slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off. Eventually one  showed up and asked me if I didn't like it. I said I only liked the chicken and she offered me some more, nice gesture, but I declined. There were maybe 15 passengers in Business class,that I believe can fit 50-60 passengers. Not a tough flight for the crew. Then came a green salad, very average,and then my book the cook meal showed up, which was good. As I like to drink with my main meal, and my glass was almost empty, as it Lasted me through the salad and the Satay, it was time to refresh my glass,but not such offer. I buzzed the cabin crew,and asked for another glass of drink. I kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up. I buzzed the crew again,and this time the flight manager showed up, I asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert. The Coke showed up in 5 seconds. Then came the dessert, a dish with Ice cream, no choices, and a Fruit basket, the most basic desert cart I ever saw. At that point I was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch Business class.  Then I wanted to rest,but the crew must turn your seat upside down, very weird idea,and even with the thin mattress ,it was far from a pampering bed.IF you feel like sitting down again,you have to call the F\/A to flip it over to a seat..Personaly I prefer control of my lying situation, rather than calling the FA. No amenity kit distributed, but I heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip -  no such basket was offered. My 14 yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry. I called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will 'take care of him' - she brought him a small pack of nuts. So much for generosity. At Aeroflot, upon hearing that my son was still hungry (growing boy,) brought him a pasta casserole from Business class. Free WiFi to Business class was a great idea. We arrived in Shanghai wondering was that Singapore Airlines we heard so much about? We really felt disappointment. Nothing really bad, just a very very ordinary trip.","TypeofTraveller":"Family Leisure","MonthFlown":"Apr-19","Route":"Copenhagen to Singapore","Class":"Business Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":4,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":2,"OverallRating":5,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"my son and i flew business class singapore to shanghai in april the business lounge in changi is ok but nothing to write home about we ordered  book the cook option one chicken brest and one steak dish upon boarding we were greeted by a very cheerful crew the flight manager already knew my name without looking at any list the seat was incredibly widebut quite hard in my opinion my tail bone tells me immediately as i was injured in a ski accident and i cant sit in a regular economy seat more than  hours i was a bit disappointed as aeroflot  business seat from moscow to shanghai was much softer and pampering after take off i went to the bathroom and upon my return i found the satay dish awaiting me i only enjoyed the chicken stick then no service for almost  min without one cabin staff in sight slowly the magic and excitement were wearing off eventually one  showed up and asked me if i didnt like it i said i only liked the chicken and she offered me some more nice gesture but i declined there were maybe  passengers in business classthat i believe can fit  passengers not a tough flight for the crew then came a green salad very averageand then my book the cook meal showed up which was good as i like to drink with my main meal and my glass was almost empty as it lasted me through the salad and the satay it was time to refresh my glassbut not such offer i buzzed the cabin crewand asked for another glass of drink i kept enjoying my meal awaiting my drink that never showed up i buzzed the crew againand this time the flight manager showed up i asked to have my drink if possible with my meal not with the dessert the coke showed up in  seconds then came the dessert a dish with ice cream no choices and a fruit basket the most basic desert cart i ever saw at that point i was already regretting the huge amount of money invested in trying to experience the top notch business class  then i wanted to restbut the crew must turn your seat upside down very weird ideaand even with the thin mattress it was far from a pampering bedif you feel like sitting down againyou have to call the fa to flip it over to a seatpersonaly i prefer control of my lying situation rather than calling the fa no amenity kit distributed but i heard that they pass by with a choice of amenities that you may find necessary for your trip   no such basket was offered my  yo son told me after the meal that he still felt hungry i called his flight attendant  who seemed amused by my statement and said she will take care of him  she brought him a small pack of nuts so much for generosity at aeroflot upon hearing that my son was still hungry growing boy brought him a pasta casserole from business class free wifi to business class was a great idea we arrived in shanghai wondering was that singapore airlines we heard so much about we really felt disappointment nothing really bad just a very very ordinary trip","polarity":-0.2,"complaints":"yes"}

Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, I\u00c6\u2019??m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her she said you can\u00c6\u2019??t use these toilets you have to go back I explained the queue situation but she wouldn\u00c6\u2019??t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that it\u00c6\u2019??s the only pram we have and we couldn\u00c6\u2019??t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with.

For my holiday to New Zealand in February \/ March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didn't receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting \/ lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didn't want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult \/ noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldn't access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasn't impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat \/ bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. I've had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider. I cant take the risk of paying for a business class fare and being placed on the A 380-800 again.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Mar-19","Route":"Singapore to Manila","Class":"Business Class","SeatComfort":3,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":5,"InflightEntertainment":5,"ValueForMoney":2,"OverallRating":5,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"singapore to london heathrow for my holiday to new zealand in february  march this year i decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class three parts of my journey were enjoyable the service and food was good even though i didnt receive the book the cook meals id ordered sadly on the last leg from singapore to london flight sq i found myself on the a i found the business class section to be cramped with a lack of storage space not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear the first problem was the width of the seat it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class i heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat she replied that bmw had designed it my thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a  hour flight where you are sitting  lying down for nearly all the time however with cushions it can be made more comfortable nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped i could see no useful purpose for it the lack of storage space was a problem i didnt want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult  noisy to access it on a night flight unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where i could put my bag on the floor but within my seating area so the aisle was still clear a stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out i couldnt access it without grovelling about on the floor i made my bed up and tried to sleep i placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill during the flight i think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head i wasnt impressed at the time but later on i did see the funny side of it as the seat  bed was narrow when i turned over i kept hitting my head it was also quite difficult to get up from ive had no such difficulties on other business class flights  the design space and attractiveness is so much better on other singapore airlines business class cabins i know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too while i was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said that thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window i had to agree a senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design thanks for the warning when i fly to australia next year i will have to look for a new provider i cant take the risk of paying for a business class fare and being placed on the a  again","polarity":-0.1,"complaints":"yes"}

{"_id":"66b85f58c4a8d6813c87dab8","Title":"you lost a loyal flyer","Name":"P Rachitra","ReviewDate":"27\/2\/2019","Airline":"Singapore Airlines","Verified":"TRUE","Reviews":"  San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didn't allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they don't want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesn't have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldn't make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up. While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I can't do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I don't have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I can't do that. They just didn't want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I don't know what is. Why can't they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?  Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though.

We booked a flight to SIN on Singapore Airlines in economy class from LAX for 11\/2018. A few days before we departed, we received an email from them encouraging us to bid on an upgrade to economy plus. Even indicated what was a low bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a fair chance. Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken. We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available. We are in our 70\u00c6\u2019??s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight. One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided. They said no, terms and conditions protect them. Beware of Singapore Airlines offers as they may not be what you expect, especially for an airline that touts their reputation. We were extremely disappointed in their offer, service, and response!

In Tokyo Haneda, check in was very efficient, despite it being a full flight (perhaps as many wanted to return home for Christmas), and boarding was very fast too, although the managing could have been better as I witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue. Despite the inclement weather, the flight took off very quickly, and after we left Tokyo the flight was smooth throughout. Aircraft wise, the A350 had always been a comfortable aircraft, and this was no exception - the product offered was very comfortable, and the legroom was good even in economy class. The cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger. After meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep, as it was a night flight. The IFE was touchscreen, just like my previous flight with SQ on their 787 and very responsive, no problems encountered. The only downside was that SQ did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the IFE - a pity, considering that the A350 has the technology and other A350 users such as Cathay Pacific and Thai Airways are using them. Not an important feature, but it would have been really cool to see it. I picked the Japanese selection for my meal, and it was very good. We arrived in Singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout. During the flight, they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook, and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers. Overall, I would recommend SQ, although the prices might sometimes be a little higher, it is worth as you are paying for what you get, and SQ is definitely one of the best out there when it comes to cabin service, matching ANA, who are known for their exceptional cabin service.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Dec-18","Route":"Singapore to Denpasar Bali","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":1,"StaffService":3,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":4,"OverallRating":10,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"flew singapore airlines on my trip back from japan on their a and the experience was really positive in tokyo haneda check in was very efficient despite it being a full flight perhaps as many wanted to return home for christmas and boarding was very fast too although the managing could have been better as i witnessed some passengers holding only an economy class ticket using the business class queue despite the inclement weather the flight took off very quickly and after we left tokyo the flight was smooth throughout aircraft wise the a had always been a comfortable aircraft and this was no exception  the product offered was very comfortable and the legroom was good even in economy class the cabin crew was also very warm and friendly and attentive to every passenger after meal service was concluded the lights were dimmed to allow the passengers to sleep as it was a night flight the ife was touchscreen just like my previous flight with sq on their  and very responsive no problems encountered the only downside was that sq did not implement a tail camera that can be broadcast on the ife  a pity considering that the a has the technology and other a users such as cathay pacific and thai airways are using them not an important feature but it would have been really cool to see it i picked the japanese selection for my meal and it was very good we arrived in singapore early and the crew was also very friendly throughout during the flight they even left me a personalized message on my passenger flight logbook and it was a really touching gesture that showed how much they cared for their passengers overall i would recommend sq although the prices might sometimes be a little higher it is worth as you are paying for what you get and sq is definitely one of the best out there when it comes to cabin service matching ana who are known for their exceptional cabin service","polarity":1.0,"complaints":"no"}

Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing. Flight was on A330, which has the 2-4-2 configuration, and as usual, I opted for the (2) seat which I increasingly like.

Flight crew were slightly less charming than usual, but I guess the last minute change probably had something to do with this, and they still dealt very politely with some very demanding customers. Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated.

Having experienced United's version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United's experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above United's, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen.

This was my first time on the A350. It was a rather empty flight from Rome to Singapore. The business class featured the new business class product where there were buttons to control the decline of the seat.

No amenity kit is provided on SQ business class but you can find toothbrush, shaving kit, comb, moisturiser and hand cream in the toilet. Only eye mask, socks and slippers are provided for long haul flights. On this route , I had the Milanese Osso Bucco for my lunch main course and it was delicious. Breakfast was served 90 minutes before arrival into Singapore and I had the Westerm option of sausage, mushrooms and omelette with corn flakes and fruits.

The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, caf?? or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure.

Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays.

I eschewed the champagne and dinner for sleep, and here I still find the SQ PE seats very stiff and difficult to recline, it really takes quite a lot of effort to force the seat into a recline position. Nonetheless, there is a reasonable amount of elbow space, and the personal reading lights, noise-cancelling earphones and cubby holes give a sense of comfort. The IFE is the new touch-screen system with a separate seat controller handset. My IFE monitor refused to come out of it's housing, but the aircrew performed some magic with a knife and fork, and saved the day! Food (the breakfast that I tried) was reasonably good, and crew were proactive with drinks and snacks through the flight. The only downside of PE in the B777 series is that access to the shared toilets is at the rear with normal economy, and you have to manage the queues for access the best you can.

Our flight over to Vietnam was quite comfortable and good service, however, the return was quite different. My bag was severely damaged in transit from Danang to Singapore. I was given the run around at Changi by staff and have to hope that I can manage a damage claim via email. The Silk air flight (which was code shared on SQ ticket) was very average. Old plane, the meal looked awful. Service was very rushed and impersonal. Singapore to Adelaide flight overnight - no sleep due to extremely badly behaved child that screamed the whole time. Staff seemed oblivious and only intervened to talk to the parents when I requested them to do so. No food served until 5 hrs into the flight despite the fact everyone was awake due to screaming child. Drinks trolley never bought through. No snack service in galley like other flights do. Very disappointed. Food was average and service slow.

Among all the times I have flown with Singapore Airlines, this trip did not feel like Singapore Airlines at all. Firstly, there was a slight delay and the ground staff did not provide any information whatsoever. A bad start to the journey. After boarding the plane, I could feel that the cabin crew lacked warmth and hospitality. Shortly after takeoff, the cabin crew came round to serve the children first. They came to serve my 8 year old Sister the meal however they did not give her two choices to choose from. They just served my Sister chicken with rice. It turns out that the chicken with rice was too spicy. There were actually two choices (beef stew and chicken with rice) which left me wondering why they did not stop to ask my Sister what choice she wanted. They didn\u00c6\u2019??t even tell her that the chicken with rice was spicy!  When the cabin crew came round to serve adults, they were very rushed and did not make themselves clear at all. They asked \u00c6\u2019??stew or chicken rice?\u00c6\u2019??. They didn\u00c6\u2019??t bother to tell us what meat the stew was. And they also did not offer any drinks. You have to ask them yourselves. The service I experienced was far from the \u00c6\u2019??superior quality\u00c6\u2019?? Singapore Airlines used to offer. I understand the need to rush service a little as the flight was only a little over two hours. However that does not mean that they can treat passengers like that.

However, the staff said that my baggage are overload (43kg in total). I  understand that baggages are overloaded, and I was happy to pay for the extra 3kg, so I asked the staff how much I have to pay for the extra KGs, she answer AUD270. So I chose to repack my baggage since I think it is more expensive than I expected. after I repacked (1kg extra), the staff asked if I can pay for the extra or not (I was surprised, since it is just 1kg more). Even though I understand that the ground staff are mostly outsourced, they are representing SQ, so I should expect professional service. The aircraft from SIN to HKG was very old that the screen is still is squared format. The meal tasted bad as well. I do not normally complain about the quality of the food as long as they are acceptable, however, I did not think that it is in an acceptable quality from world No. 1 airline. Thirdly, I am not sure if all airlines are like this or not, however, from the meal menu, they have 3 courses to choose, I was informed that they only have 2 courses though.

The experience was excellent - from the business class SilverKris Lounge at LHR to the onboard service. The plane we were on had the relatively new business class seats, which were superbly comfortable and afforded a truly relaxing journey, with a good range of entertainment, food and drink (we used the 'Book the Cook' to have our own choice from the extensive menu).

Singapore Airlines is my best economy flight experiences so far. When I arrived at Hong Kong airport, I mentioned to the ground crew doing my check-in that I was concerned about any delay as I only had 3 hours of layover at London Heathrow when I had to clear customs and wait for my checked bag before I travel from terminal 2 to terminal 5 to catch the BA flight to Leeds. She called someone and then went to ask her superior when she couldn\u00c6\u2019??t get answer on the phone to see if it\u00c6\u2019??s possible to check my bag to Leeds. I knew they couldn\u00c6\u2019??t do that when the two airlines belong to different airline partnerships (One World for BA and Star Alliance for SQ).  When I came back to Hong Kong a week later, I asked the ground crew at check-in if they might have any row of 3-seaters available,  ground crew looked to see if two rows that were blocked could be released. She then assigned the aisle seat, blocked the middle seat, and said she would do her best not to assign anyone to the window seat if possible.  I was able to lie down from London to Singapore. When they served the main meal, I told a flight attendant that I wanted Peppermint tea  and I brought my own as other airlines I have flown never had peppermint tea. He said they did. Not only did he bring me a cup, he also gave me a few bags of them for my layover at the Singapore airport. SQ has the most comfortable pillow for economy class in my experience. The blanket was twice the size and thicker than that of United. The economy passengers also got an amenitY kit (socks, toothbrush, toothpaste) .

This trip was our first experience of Singapore Airlines premium economy. Priority check-in and boarding was quick and easy, with a friendly welcome and offer of assistance from the crew. The premium economy cabin is just three rows in a 2-4-2 configuration, and there is plenty of locker space. The seats are comfortable with a good level of recline and good leg room. There is a calf support, but this serves little purpose, plus a leg rest from the seat in front. Their is a 13inch HD entertainment screen with excellent sound reducing earphones. Having experienced Singapore Airlines excellent economy class service levels, expectations of an even better premium experience are unfortunately not met. Service is economy level. There are no pre- take off drinks, and although champagne is offered when drinks are served after take off, it is in a tiny plastic faux wine glass. Wine is of mediocre quality served in a plastic tumbler. Top ups are a long time in coming as there are no dedicated premium economy crew, and the same staff serve the economy cabin. Meals were the same as economy with extras such as tablecloths absent. The main reason for traveling premium economy is space and comfort, and we had a very comfortable flight and slept well.

After the layover in Singapore, the ground handling for the 2nd leg was very good and boarding commenced with only slight delay. The service on this flight began shortly after takeoff, but it was a bit rushed during late dinner was served, and I didn't get the dessert. But since it was an ample and tasty dinner, I didn't mind at all since it was already 2am as well. The selection on IFE was superb, but the flight information is a bit outdated, since it was a non-refurbished aircraft. After I called FA for a mid-term snack an ample snack was served. Shortly before arrival a very tasty breakfast was served less rushed than the dinner. Overall the FA's did a great job!

Singapore Airlines is very dependable and the standards always high as is expected of a 5-star airline. The check-in counters are almost always free or have no more than one other guest in front of you. This is something I never take for granted and often a welcomed relief especially if I have travelled quite far to get to the airport. Knowing that check-ins can be done in under 5 mins from reaching the airport is an experience I've always looked forward to when flying with SQ, no matter which country I am in. The check-in staff are always pleasant and polite which sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The welcoming experience is often replicated at boarding when a senior cabin crew checks my boarding pass and welcomes me on board. SQ sets itself apart from the rest of the airlines by showcasing their best and possibly their most senior crew at the boarding area. The inflight entertainment offers an excellent selection of movies and shorter programmes. More importantly, Singapore Airlines allows passengers to use the inflight entertainment as soon as they are seated.

Lie down bed takes a bit of getting used to for set-up and pack away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's great. Helps you to sleep much more than when sitting. Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason.

This time we took our adult daughter too - 'the shopper'. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: 'Safety first; we don't compensate for delays or connections - if missed' (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldn't recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ.

I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each other\u00c6\u2019??s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardess\u00c6\u2019??s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasn\u00c6\u2019??t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQ\u00c6\u2019??s book the cook option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldn\u00c6\u2019??t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasn\u00c6\u2019??t great. I wasn\u00c6\u2019??t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt\/Singapore flight. I can\u00c6\u2019??t recommend SQ and probably won\u00c6\u2019??t chose to fly with them again.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jan-18","Route":"Tokyo to Los Angeles","Class":"Business Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":5,"ValueForMoney":2,"OverallRating":3,"Recommended":"no","cleaned_review":"frankfurt to singapore business class i got an email early morning on  january to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by  hours as i was connecting with air new zealand at singapore onwards to auckland with a short connection time i thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to auckland was going to be impossible that proved correct prior to arriving at the airport i rung both sq and air new zealand both airlines claimed it was each others responsibility in short sq was to blame for the disruption so it was their responsibility to put things right when we were due to board at frankfurt the a was not at the terminal it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away when we finally arrived at the plane we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through the greeting from the staff was very hohum the crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight the poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way he asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section the stewardesss response was sorry we are fully booked this wasnt the case as there was a vacant seat behind me the meals were very asian with a lot of seafood options in some cases i chose to forego the course as there was just nothing i liked i would recommend sqs book the cook option there are far more options available using this than sq offers on the flight come time to sleep my bed was broken it lay flat ok its just that when i put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldnt sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor i slept but it wasnt great i wasnt the only one to complain of this problem when the flight arrived in singapore there were a team of sq agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay in all fairness sq did handle this very well they provided a  star airport hotel for  hours along with  meals the journey on to new zealand continued with sq and i can basically say i saw a repeat of the service issues i had on the frankfurtsingapore flight i cant recommend sq and probably wont chose to fly with them again","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

The attentive crew made flying long haul by economy into a lovely experience. From Brisbane, the B777-200er plane was a bit dated, noisy and the seats were comparatively hard. Some seats have IFE boxes taking up some foot space, and the entertainment selection is more limited than the newer planes (e.g. No full box sets). However the crew service with hot towels, amenities packs and attention to detail more than made up for it. The first leg was late departing Brisbane, but without even having to ask, the staff on the ground assured us by announcement that we would make up time en route and sure enough, we did, even arriving early into Changi. This was a relief for me as I only had a 50 minute connection time. The plane change at Changi was easy and seamless. The second leg was on the B77-300er. I found this plane less quiet than the A380 alternative on this leg, but still very comfortable. The ambient lighting and temperature were pleasant.

You paiy for more leg room but got an entertainment system in the armseat that is less pleasant than the normal, so, I'd say that's not worth it. But, anyway, service was good, but not extraordinary.

Both cabins were the new Business fit out and the seats (11K and 11A respectively) were of the new set up. The only issue is that I think there is a lack of storage space, and no drink tray (which is available on the A380) The A350 arrangement is newer of course and the individual cabin seems a bit smaller than those on the A380 and B777 (although the seat is the same width as on the B777). In reality the size seems to be on a good scale and uses the space well - it is very comfortable and all works well, and very roomy. Interestingly we were handed a small amenities kit on the Singapore to Barcelona flight - a first in my experience with SIA. The service on both flights was top notch and the attendants very friendly and attentive. The A350 flight seemed to be full, but the service was of a very high standard. We had a short stopover in Milan where we had to remain on the plane and there was a crew change. One of the flight attendants came up to say goodbye as she was leaving the plane. Very personal service. The A350 is a terrific plane - very quiet (much more so than the B777) and very smooth. I did feel better after this flight than other long haul flights so maybe the extra humidity and air pressure and better air conditioning worked. Meals and drinks were of a high standard and the toilet to passenger ratio seemed good.

The service from the crew was excellent, with food, beverages and complimentary items. It was a 10 hour flight but it went by quickly thanks to the wonderful seat back entertainment system. There were more movies than you could ever hope to watch during a flight, as well as games, tv-series, books and music, all of it free! The only thing you had to pay for was the wifi.

Our outbound leg was operated by a brand new A350. Despite the usually unremarkable ground service in CGK, we walked into the plane with high expectations, being known as a prestigious carrier here in Indonesia. Our previous flights with them has also been excellent. However, walking out of a Singapore Airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more. Sure, the A350 was an excellent aircraft in itself, with a spacious cabin, larger windows, high-tech LCDs for overhead signs and increased humidity, but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines. Seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests. Seat width was great, while pitch was nothing remarkable. Service was noticeably rushed, though crew were still professional, efficient and quite friendly. IFE was the most sophisticated and content-loaded I have ever experienced - complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller. However, it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information. And then the food came: every single portion of the meal was lackluster - very severely below industry standards. Also, the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight, at an ear-splitting volume - they rung at least once every thirty seconds. How incredible. What's more, turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well, and when it was time to land, we hit the ground very hard. Kudos to the pilot. The return flight was operated by a 16-year old 777-300, a stark contrast to the brand new A350 of the previous flight. However, this was much better: food quality was raised to industry standards - good, but not great, service was friendlier, but still far from the best out there, seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests; the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence. But what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in Economy Class receives: the amount of legroom was mind blowing. I could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic. However, this flight also comes with its own share of flaws: crew service was not as efficient - they spent the first 20 minutes of cruise heating up food, and this caused my row to get the food only 30 minutes before arrival, and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent. Also, the IFE system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade. The screens were also falling apart as well. Overall an inconsistent experience onboard SQ that has slightly declined since I flew them last three years ago.","TypeofTraveller":"Family Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jul-17","Route":"Sydney to Amsterdam via Singapore","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":4,"StaffService":2,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":4,"OverallRating":7,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"flew from jakarta to singapore return our outbound leg was operated by a brand new a despite the usually unremarkable ground service in cgk we walked into the plane with high expectations being known as a prestigious carrier here in indonesia our previous flights with them has also been excellent however walking out of a singapore airlines plane for the first time in three years left us wanting for more sure the a was an excellent aircraft in itself with a spacious cabin larger windows hightech lcds for overhead signs and increased humidity but unfortunately the flight experience overall has fallen miserably compared to our past flights with them as well as with competing airlines seat comfort was good but not great due to the hard leather headrests seat width was great while pitch was nothing remarkable service was noticeably rushed though crew were still professional efficient and quite friendly ife was the most sophisticated and contentloaded i have ever experienced  complete with an extremely high resolution remote controller however it was not useful other than accessing shortcuts and viewing brief flight information and then the food came every single portion of the meal was lackluster  very severely below industry standards also the ding sounds were played excessively throughout the flight at an earsplitting volume  they rung at least once every thirty seconds how incredible whats more turbulence kept coming and going throughout the entire flight as well and when it was time to land we hit the ground very hard kudos to the pilot the return flight was operated by a year old  a stark contrast to the brand new a of the previous flight however this was much better food quality was raised to industry standards  good but not great service was friendlier but still far from the best out there seat comfort was elevated thanks in part to the very soft and plush leather headrests the constant ding sounds were replaced by an overall calmer ride interspersed with brief periods of turbulence but what impressed me was the amount of space that each passenger in economy class receives the amount of legroom was mind blowing i could stretch out and still not feel claustrophobic however this flight also comes with its own share of flaws crew service was not as efficient  they spent the first  minutes of cruise heating up food and this caused my row to get the food only  minutes before arrival and we finished our desserts as the plane was already midway through descent also the ife system is ancient and is in desperate need for a upgrade the screens were also falling apart as well overall an inconsistent experience onboard sq that has slightly declined since i flew them last three years ago","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

Inattentive staff, cold food, broken in-flight entertainment equipment and terrible service.  I was with a friend when I boarded this flight and going back to Singapore after a semester of studies in Perth. We just had a rude encounter with a staff at the boarding gate and was hoping to get a warm welcome from fellow Singaporeans on the SIA flight. However we were received with hostile treatment from the cabin staff serving us on the flight. Had to pass through 5 flight attendants before we finally got an apple juice. First 2 attendants conveniently missed us when serving drinks to other passengers. The next 2 forgot our orders. Throughout these 5 encounters, we were received with rude attitudes which irritated, annoyed and angered us. It was a truly frustrating flight. A flight attendant also missed me when serving meals, had to be served by another from the other aisle. Apart from that, in-flight entertainment was faulty, didnt bother to announce before rebooting and after restarting. My remote had 1 button missing. Meals were not hot and rice was hard. I had previously tried Scoot for the first time from Singapore to Perth. Although the food was terrible, they provided a quality of service that could rival a full service airline and definitely beat the one provided by SQ on this particular flight.  Before this flight, I absolutely adored SQ. Now, I am seriously considering boycotting this airline for the treatment I received on flight. I seriously wonder if the old cabin crew who had built up such a wonderful reputation for SQ had moved on to serve in Scoot.

{"_id":"66b85f58c4a8d6813c87dbb0","Title":"this flight was a terrible disappointment","Name":"Richard Todd","ReviewDate":"21\/6\/2017","Airline":"Singapore Airlines","Verified":"FALSE","Reviews":"  My wife and I flew to London last week, with a Singapore stopover, choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on Qantas premium economy. We expected Singapore Airlines, another favourite carrier, to offer a similar product, and we had both had good Singapore Airlines flights before. But this flight was a terrible disappointment, and poor value for money. We are not looking forward to the return flight next month. With Singapore Airlines premium economy, you get a wider seat and better leg room. At the airport you check in separately, and there's a more generous luggage allowance. But that's all you get. We got the same food as economy (poor food compared to previous Singapore Airlines economy flights). The flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy. Perhaps they were run off their feet: the only smiles were the neon-light style: turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again. When the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top, but it was not offered. We were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee. I requested a glass of red, and was given it. I've no idea what sort of wine it was. The curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best, and far from what Singapore Airlines has offered in the past. Nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine, tea of coffee. After each meal, it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays, so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet. My wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself. Flight attendants were there, but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays. On the long night flight leg to London a day later it was much the same. We were not even offered eye masks, though I was given one when I requested it. I've never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasn't offered. The curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight, and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will. As we approached London, our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture, which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been. But it hadn't finished yet: On arrival at Heathrow, people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off. No flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off, not even a cabin announcement. Most cabin announcements during were barely audible, even in an aircraft as quiet as an A380, so that might not have made much of a difference. To sum up: we used to praise Singapore Airlines to the skies, but the scales have fallen from our eyes.This was an appalling way to start our holiday, and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again.","TypeofTraveller":"Couple Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jun-17","Route":"Singapore to Munich","Class":"Premium Economy","SeatComfort":4,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":5,"ValueForMoney":1,"OverallRating":2,"Recommended":"no","cleaned_review":"my wife and i flew to london last week with a singapore stopover choosing premium economy because we had a great experience flying on qantas premium economy we expected singapore airlines another favourite carrier to offer a similar product and we had both had good singapore airlines flights before but this flight was a terrible disappointment and poor value for money we are not looking forward to the return flight next month with singapore airlines premium economy you get a wider seat and better leg room at the airport you check in separately and theres a more generous luggage allowance but thats all you get we got the same food as economy poor food compared to previous singapore airlines economy flights the flight attendants served us and a large chunk of economy perhaps they were run off their feet the only smiles were the neonlight style turn on a smile and instantly turn it off again when the food trolley came along there was a bottle of red and and a bottle of white wine on the top but it was not offered we were asked simply whether we wanted tea or coffee i requested a glass of red and was given it ive no idea what sort of wine it was the curried beef meal was poor economy class food at best and far from what singapore airlines has offered in the past nobody came around after the meal to offer more wine tea of coffee after each meal it took half an hour for anyone to come and remove our trays so we were stuck in our seats and unable to go the toilet my wife eventually lost patience and took her tray and returned it to the kitchen herself flight attendants were there but offered no thanks or apology for the delay in retrieving the trays on the long night flight leg to london a day later it was much the same we were not even offered eye masks though i was given one when i requested it ive never flown an international night flight before when an eye mask wasnt offered the curtain between premium economy and economy was never closed on either flight and children from economy wandered into our aisle at will as we approached london our last meal was a breakfast omelet of rubbery texture which seemed to underscore the whole mediocre experience this premium economy flight had been but it hadnt finished yet on arrival at heathrow people in economy poured from their seats into our part of the aircraft before the seatbelt light had been turned off no flight attendants told them to stay in their seats until those ahead of them had got off not even a cabin announcement most cabin announcements during were barely audible even in an aircraft as quiet as an a so that might not have made much of a difference to sum up we used to praise singapore airlines to the skies but the scales have fallen from our eyesthis was an appalling way to start our holiday and it will take a lot to get us to return to flying with this airline again","polarity":-0.8,"complaints":"yes"}

I have been flying with Singapore Airlines in Economy a couple of times in the past and was under the impression that I really like flying with them.

The crews seemed disorganized, very mechanic, and provided slightly chaotic and\/or unnecessary stressed meal services. The first beverage service consisted of pre-filled cups with wine and beer served from a tray that the FA carried through the aisle. Kinda strange. Why not hand out little wine bottles (as Lufthansa does) and cans of beers instead? If no one takes the cups, do they pour them out? The planes were fairly old, featuring ancient inflight systems. I also dislike with Singapore Airlines that during online set selection, one is only being shown very few available seats - and when you sit down, the seats that were shown occupied suddenly are empty, while the one next to you which was shown available is occupier. I understand that there always are last minute changes but I still notice a repeating pattern; with other airlines (within Star Alliance) I usually am able to make smarter seat choices than when flying with SIA. The food was good. Overall, if Singapore Airline wants to maintain its position as a serious premium airline, it has to improve the overall pleasantness of the flight experience.

It is a disappointing travel experience. The flight from Hong to Singapore (SQ871) was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived Singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. Yet my next flight from Singapore to Brisbane (SQ255) was going to depart in about 40 minutes. It was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time. A better arrangement would be appreciated as this pattern happens daily. As soon as I landed in Singapore, the staff informed me that my luggage could not get on the same flight as mine because of the time constraint and that I had to make a report after landing in Brisbane. However, no further detail was given and I was not sure where and who to talk to. The flight from Singapore to Brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between Singapore and Brisbane offices about my luggage. When I landed in Brisbane, I was directed to the office after asking a flight attendant and then the counter staff at departure. I would appreciate if I was given a better instruction in Singapore (or at least before landing) so that I would not need to run around in the airport. I told the lady at the office about my situation and showed her my flight tickets and passport. However, she did not check anything about my luggage and kept giving me confusing information. She told me my luggage should be in the baggage claim and I had to wait at the airport for an uncertain amount of time since I went through custom already and could not go back in anymore. Then she said the staff had paged me at baggage claim but I did not respond. However, I did not hear any announcement in baggage claim. When I asked her whether my luggage was in Brisbane or Singapore, she was not sure. I would\u00c6\u2019??ve appreciated if she could check for me before saying anything.

You had to press the call button for anything, mid-flight snacks were available but again, nothing was offered voluntarily. Flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. No landing cards handed out. Except for the seat itself, the service on the return flight SIN-SFO in regular Economy was actually better, with a pre-lunch drinks run (from a tray, not a full cart) and follow-up hot beverage service after the meal. As with the outbound flight, however, the second meal service - a breakfast - took place about six hours before landing, what gives?

Got to Sydney airport early. Checked in online and dropped bags. Friendly ground crew directed me to Business Class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. No issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. Boarding at Gate 61, a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full A380. Departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in SIN. Meal ok, but cabin crew seemed almost robotic, rehearsed and fake. Lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. Seat 60K in economy. After sometime realized my back was aching. Discovered that seat had no lumbar support, some did, mine didn't and couldn't fully recline either. Not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to SIN. Didn't bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota.

The service is great, a regular drink tray with waters and juices being brought to you to keep you hydrated. The food was decent for economy class standards and they also offered a small snack (sandwich) and second meal. A small amenity pack was provided and consisted of a toothbrush and socks - nothing special but still a tick in the box which some airlines have cut back on. The headrest of the seat is comfy and is made of leather which gives it class. Ambient lighting during the night hours gave a relaxed and upmarket feel. The best part of the Economy seat was the entertainment system which consisted of a large screen - bigger than an iPad size and then has a small digital control below; it all works well and is also touchscreen and the quality and size is better than I've seen on BA business 747.

Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didn't see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative. I have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it, I do recommend Singapore Airlines.

I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQ's crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passenger's immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bin's lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown. I can't wait to experience the A350 on this route, and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Feb-17","Route":"London to Singapore","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":1,"InflightEntertainment":5,"ValueForMoney":4,"OverallRating":10,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"singapore to new york via frankfurt i have flown the sinnyc route  times in the last  months in my earlier trips i flew with a large european carrier and two different middle eastern carriers i last flown sq on this route over  years ago so i can compare the recent experience with that from  years ago the main thing to me that distinguished sq service from competitors is cabin crew service one thing which i felt was lacking though is the smiles that sqs crew used to be famous for some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly i noticed in my last  or so flights on sq in the past  months that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be a small minority seem a little indifferent which drags sq reputation down their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the middle eastern carriers a feels older compared with the bs and as that many airlines are now using despite the older planes i find the generous seat width a life saver other details include lights under the ife screens which gave good coverage for each passengers immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets helps not having to push the bins lids using our hands there was good crew presence throughout the entire flight the food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers i have flown i cant wait to experience the a on this route and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

Superb product! Right from boarding till reaching Changi. Boarding began in time and orderly, zone wise boarding which helped in quick boarding and we left within 25 minutes considering it was a fairly full flight. We were greeted by delightful and genuine crew. The aircraft was clean and business class is the best I have seen. Premium economy seats are very comfortable with lots of options to store gadgets, charging point, usb port and big hd screen with many options. As soon as we were airborne, hot towel service followed by snack and drink followed by meals. I used the cook the book service, passengers using such option are served first, this doesn't allow you to dine with your fellow passengers unless you wait. Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs. Although captain announced turbulence and turned on seatbelt sign, crew walked through cabin with torch to check seat belts and ensured we fasten it.

I don't think so","Name":"W Larkham","ReviewDate":"29\/1\/2017","Airline":"Singapore Airlines","Verified":"FALSE","Reviews":"  Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that's something I haven't seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen't feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don't think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jan-17","Route":"HND to SIN","Class":"Premium Economy","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":2,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":1,"OverallRating":5,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"sydney to london heathrow via singapore i normally fly china southern business class from sydney to london and i pay for the tickets myself as i fly to the uk to see my parents and family this year my father turns  in february so i am flying to london twice this year and in order to save  i decided that one flight had to be an economy one not being able to face true economy i booked a premium economy seat with singapore airlines i have flown premium economy with other airlines over the years qantas ba and virgin atlantic when they still flew to oz firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent i went on to the singapore airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and book the chef meals  out of  for their online presence easy to use compared with china southern which is a nightmare at the airport no queue for the dedicated premium economy checkin staff member very polite no lounge access but sydney airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy boarding was a breeze as premium economy have priority with business and first on the plane the fas were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and thats something i havent seen for a while boarding was swift on both sectors the captains introduced themselves and we left on time soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served i prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass also no slice of lemon the meal service came next all served on one tray the quality of the food was good but very small and no different from economy throughout the flight fas came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided the fas were always polite and friendly and came when requested i never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate we arrived early on both sectors disembarkation was quick my flight cost a return an economy ticket on the same flights a a china southern business class ticket a if booked at the same time so there is the rub was it worth it well yes and no the seat is more comfortable even with the seat in front fuly reclined i still had space the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive the problem arises when the singapore airlines product is compared to the likes of qantas it just doent feel special there are no seperate toilets the food is the same as economy during the flight the curtain between premium economy and economy is not even closed in other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space an ecomomy plus rather than a premium economy and is that worth the extra a i dont think so if i could have my time again i think i would either spend the extra a and fly business with china southern or have stopped over on each direction with  to spend on hotels and entertainment","polarity":0.15,"complaints":"no"}

This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesn't mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crew's perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldn't mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesn't help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ. Cabin Wifi: The rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors. It didn't also work for a good part of the journey. I am aware there are restricted zones but I have flown on the similar route with another competitor and haven't had much issues with the Wifi. Overall, I would fly Singapore Airlines again and hopefully some of the above issues may be resolved with more A350's being delivered.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jan-17","Route":"MEL to SIN","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":1,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":3,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":4,"OverallRating":8,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"i flew on singapore airlines sq from sydney to chennai via singapore last december this was my first time on sq and was quite excited about the journey as i had heard a lot about them general all my flights were ontime infact some arriving a bit earlier the seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors i wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken luckily when i checkedin it showed one window seat on each sector and i was able to take it not sure why sq should make it complicated i do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc but that doesnt mean you block the whole flight value for money the ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors however i am willing to pay for quality hence i would opt for sq ground service ground staff in both sydney and singapore were friendly and the checkin process was smooth seat comfort the seats were spacious though i am average sized i felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably cabin staff service cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world prompt service my only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink within usual limits in a competitor i got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic i am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crews perspective also when you request a spirit its taken like a special order which will come after a while ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks like other competitors do and should be served instantly food  beverages the quality of food was excellent the quantity could be a bit more but i will live with it inflight entertainment one of their weakest points in this current era of touch screens we have to use remote control on both their a and a fleet also the choice of movies are very limited a cheap takeaway earphone and outdated software i wouldnt mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight i have read that their retrofitted ber and a come with touch screens but that doesnt help anyone as a and a still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes as an aviation enthusiast i used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor unfortunately its not available on sq cabin wifi the rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors it didnt also work for a good part of the journey i am aware there are restricted zones but i have flown on the similar route with another competitor and havent had much issues with the wifi overall i would fly singapore airlines again and hopefully some of the above issues may be resolved with more as being delivered","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

I was looking forward to fly the A350. After booking the flight I received an offer to upgrade to Premium Economy, but I rejected after reading a number of reviews.

Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level.  Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that.

Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor -  Economy class food. The only reason why I've given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit.  The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price.

Flew from Sydney to Colombo via Singapore. Although we were in economy the aircraft was clean, ground crew and cabin crew were friendly and attentive throughout and food and entertainment were fine. The seat on the return leg on the upper deck of the A380 was so comfortable I had to be woken for breakfast. It was on the return leg that this airline really impressed me. At Singapore there was a technical problem with the A380 slotted to fly us back to Sydney. We were advised immediately and reallocated to another gate where within an hour, the entire passenger list was boarded onto another A380 and we departed 1 hour late. Who has a 'spare' A380 with flight crew ready to go with passengers boarded in 60 minutes? They also made up the time and landed us in Sydney ahead of schedule by about 5 minutes. This is a very impressive performance and one that some other airlines might seek to emulate. We flew Air New Zealand to San Francisco in May and a technical fault in Sydney saw us trapped in the airport for 8 hours, miss our connection in Auckland and lose a day out of our trip. No-one should be blamed for technical problems but the rude and unprofessional manner in which ground staff at Sydney airport managed passenger enquiries was unparalleled in my 44 years of flying.

Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one.

First time I had flown Singapore Airlines in over 25 years and I had very high expectations. First impression was that the interior looked clean but slightly dated. The seats were comfortable but the armrests didn't come all the way up - which was annoying. Had 3 seats to myself on one flight but couldn't stretch\/sleep due to the arms rests. Legroom was above average at 32 inches and much appreciated. The individual TV was very old and screen quality was poor. The cheap headphones meant that the sound was fuzzy and after 30 mins I gave up. This was the case on all 4 long haul flights. Very disappointing. Selection was average. Compared to Emirates or Turkish Airlines it was remarkably bad. Even the moving map was ancient. Needs massive improvement. Service was excellent through the flight. Crew very polite and proactive. Food \/ drinks were generally good. Asian dishes were excellent and they gave me a second hot meal on request. Icecream for dessert was fun. Snacks were also provided as were drinks between meals.

Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard.

I was stranded at JFK a bit after 9.00pm because at the counter at the gate was no one anymore and the tiny booth is only occupied a few hours at odd hours per day. So I called the 1-800 # on my booking confirmation and was told that they would put me on the very next flight at 8.55am, yes the person said am! But as all offices are closed now I will get a confirmation call once they open the next morning! Learned later that they are in San Francisco, 3 hours behind us. So I went back to the other Terminal to the help desk of JetBlue, which had the delayed plane - after more than an hour with several phone calls I finally got a room in an hotel for the night, I finally made it after midnight into my room. The next morning I rushed to the Airport only to learn that there is no am flight ! The flight is apparently daily at 8.55 pm. I couldn't believe what I was told on the phone. I already spent a short night without my luggage or personal belongings and fresh clothes and now I had to sit another 12 hours around. Once the booth from Singapore Airline was occupied at 2.55 pm I told them about my dilemma and he called his supervisor to find out if I could reschedule my flight back from FRA, Germany to JFK : instead of Oct. 03, 2016 to one or two days later because of my lost 24 hours here at the Airport. Nope, nothing to do, because I already have gotten an hotel room for the night ! Unbelievable, I would have slept in a corner at the Airport they would have rescheduled my flight back home?

Wow there really is - I discovered - not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see, even with lighting altered and the screen tilted, blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally, but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you can't get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good, very attentive parents, I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll, muffin and a little bit of fruit.

Would not recommend flying with Singapore Airlines if you are a musician who values their instruments. Never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as I went to book into my flight at Brisbane I was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that I'd have to stow it under the plane. After a long discussion with the manager about how I've never had any trouble before and that it'd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception. I came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so I would have to stow the instrument, I was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. I was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. Upon arriving back home I'm sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. What made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldn't be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. I know it's not Singapore Airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but I'm less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline I've flown has had no problems with it.

I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I don't feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyone's flight be disrupted and stressful due to others' selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyone's sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they don't deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers. This was over 4 flights and I felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jul-16","Route":"BCN to GRU","Class":"Premium Economy","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":5,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":2,"OverallRating":4,"Recommended":"no","cleaned_review":"flew sydney to amsterdam returning from paris to sydney both via singapore in july i had researched premium economy with sia the flight on a tended to be more comfortable with more room boarding in sydney was chaotic and confusing the a seat to amsterdam was very uncomfortable front row and the foot rest was redundant  i am  cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if i wanted more if was begrudgingly offered food book the cook was okay considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely if ever were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed this was more for the convenience of fa who were moving between premium and economy with food trolleys etc many economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin especially when nursing crying babies also noise especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in a flights  very noisy even with noise cancelling headphones certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost  i dont feel it was anywhere near value for money my biggest concern and complaint which i made to fa and even to sia customer service on cdg to sin flight july  was when parents left their two boys in premium economy while they took themselves off to business class they did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices i had to stop them from damaging the lights the window shutters clambering over their seats especially the young boy of  years the fa cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers in this day and age this is a big concern anything could have happened to the boys what if there was an emergency  who would look after them they became very restless and eventually i complained to fa but nothing was done the parents were inconsiderate selfish and irresponsible singapore airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax as a passenger why should anyones flight be disrupted and stressful due to others selfishness as in this case this is not about whatever class your in airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyones sake also if anything happened to the children who is liable  the other passengers the airline would i fly sia premium economy again  i seriously doubt it it has potential but if they dont deliver on their marketing promises i will fly other airlines who do also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint if you overpromise and under deliver consistently you have dissatisfied customers this was over  flights and i felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall","polarity":-0.75,"complaints":"yes"}

I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29\/07\/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. I'm also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine\/champagne (if you're very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact I've had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars.

Out of MNL via a very, very old B772ER with the very, very old recliner seats with pull out screens in a 2-3-2 configuration. Singapore Airlines should retire or refit this plane soon.

Despite the trademark efficient, if not cold, SQ style service and tasty in-flight catering, very little can justify premium SQ pricing. The recliners are not a big issue on the short 3.5 hour flight and can actually be quite comfortable for a quick snooze after the meal service, but the screen is prone to glare, and my wife's screen was just malfunctioning the whole trip, making her experience not much different from a recent J class experience on a shorter MNL-HKG trip on PR with no IFE save for borrowed iPads. There wasn't the standard stowage space you'd expect from more modern J class products, but the toilets were clean and the amenities plentiful. So disappointed on this leg. Onward journey from SIN to DPS on a more modern A330 with angled-lie flat seats and a 15 inch seatback IFE AVOD system. Better product with more stowage areas.

In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times.

A380 on the upper level Business Class section. Service on Singapore Airlines is top notch, staff are very friendly and professional and treat passengers quite well. Food and drinks selections are excellent with a wide range of choices available. Having flown on several A380's primarily those operated by Singapore Airlines, I have found that this one offers some of the older seating which I am not terribly fond of. My problem with the seats is that the foot rest shelf is offset and does not allow for one to site with their legs straight ahead, instead you have to angle your legs slightly which is uncomfortable. Also on these older planes, the electrical controls for the seats are showing their age and heavy use by being slow to respond or not respond at all. For converting your seat into a bed, there is unfortunately no information provided and either requires you to spend a great deal of time figuring it out or waiting for an attendant to help you (or watch them while they help someone else). Basically the latch to release the seat back is located on the upper outer edge towards the aisle, but is well concealed so not easy to find even by touch. You must also make sure that the seat is in the full upright position before trying to convert it to a bed. Another problem that I have encountered is that the temperature in the cabins is usually on the warm side which makes it difficult to sleep well. With regards to inflight WiFi, it would be nice if this was included for Business Class and Suites passengers considering the cost of tickets on Singapore Airlines.

A waste of money! Check-in took almost an hour. This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable. This resulted in having to rush through passport control and the TRS and left me with about 15- 20 minutes to quickly eat something before having to board the 4pm flight. The business class cabin was full of children. I had booked the flight 1 week prior and opted for the afternoon flight as the reservations agent had told me it was almost empty. I understand loads can change, but if I had known I would have opted for the evening flight even though this would have allowed only about 1 hour 30 minutes in Changi before catching the connecting flight. The food was inedible - my specially selected chef inspired meal of Tasmanian salmon was dry, with rubbery beans and overcooked pasta. The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional. The business class lounge staff and most of the flight attendants were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not enough to redeem this airline.

{"_id":"66b85f58c4a8d6813c87dc5a","Title":"no attempt to address our complaint","Name":"Wayne Burgess","ReviewDate":"29\/2\/2024","Airline":"Qatar Airways","Verified":"TRUE","Reviews":"  I have sent 5 emails and have only received 2 automatic response emails after initiating our complaint 10 weeks ago. I have sent all of the relevant documentation to support our claim for a refund. Our group of 3 booked adjoining Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck of an A380 from Doha to Perth after a connecting flight from Amman. We paid for our Exit Row seats on August 22 2023 and received email confirmation that day. What was a shock to us is that when we were at Amman airport we got our tickets for the second leg, from Doha to Perth, we saw that we had been seats on the lower deck. We said this was wrong and showed our August confirmation for seats 30 A, B and C on the upper deck. We were told by Qatar Airways staff in Amman that it could only be fixed up in Doha. We were also told that the reason was that the plane had been changed from an A380 (which was not correct) . Our connecting flight from Amman to Doha was not only cancelled but deleted altogether meaning we had a 10.5 hour transit instead of the original 2.5 hours. Then at the Boarding Gate in Amman we were informed that there were 2 Exit Row seats available in the Upper Deck and that these had been put on hold for us and to see the Qatar Ground staff in Doha. We were in a queue for almost an hour at the Qatar Service Desk in Doha. I asked how the seats we had booked and paid extra for in August, and provided emails and a hard copy to verify this, were no longer available for us? We were told that it was a system error. There was no apology at all for the system error. We were further disappointed to find out that the 2 Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck that we had been told by staff at the boarding Gate at Amman had been reserved were not actually retained for us and that only 1 Exit Row seat was available. Understandably we were not happy that we did not receive the Exit Row seats that we had booked and paid for more than 3 months prior. Through no fault of our own we were victims of a Qatar Airways system error. We did not complain to the flight attendants on the Doha to Perth flight as we understood that they had no control over the seat allocation. However, we politely asked the people in seats 30A and 30B, that we had paid for in August, when they had purchased their seats and were informed that they had done so about 2 weeks prior. I chose Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck because of the extra space and the cabin configuration of 2 by 4 by 2 seats and because my wife and I would be seated next to each other and the other member of our group would be in the next available Exit Row seat. Instead of all being seated next to each other in Exit Row seats we were split up and certainly didn\u00c6\u2019??t get what we paid for. Plus all of the wasted time trying unsuccessfully in Amman and then at the Transit Desk in Doha to sort out the error created by Qatar Airways assigning our seats to someone else. It is bad enough that we didn\u00c6\u2019??t get 2 of the Exit Row seats that we had paid for that were allocated to other people who booked well after us. What is worse is that there has been no attempt by Qatar Airways to address our complaint let alone issue the refund to which we are entitled. Our complaint isn\u00c6\u2019??t complex.

This part of the flight is with American Airlines. American had no other flights leaving BWI for the rest of the day and I needed to get a connecting flight from Chicago to Doha. They only could offer a flight leaving the next nearest airport 40 miles away w\/ no way to get there and it would also change my return flight to that same airport. This was not an option for me so I decided to make a last-minute decision to fly another airline that was flying out of BWI at a cost. I figured I could get refunded for that part of the flight from Qatar or even American - sadly not. American told me that Qatar would have to refund it. On the ground at the airport in CHI, it was a mess. It took an hour to get through check-in. While weather was bad, there were enough agents. Getting to the gate and waiting to board wasn't a problem. I got an upgraded seat in economy class that had plenty of space. My return flight I picked the same seat and had another seatmate with an upgraded experience. Now between these two fights I'd say the first wasn't as bad because the attendant also gave me my food right after my seatmate. Shouldn't be an issue , since you have the cart of food right there. Why on the return flight I didn't get my meal until the attendant came back after he went up to the front of the plane. Inflight entertainment was top notch. There were plenty of movies, TV shows and music. The internet was choppy w\/ my device so I just stayed w\/ the entertainment they provided. I also think the food was great.

Briefly on time. Gate boarding functioned well through division of passengers into 4 zones. I was treated with respect and served excellently. Food and drinks were informed online prior to travel, which had raised my expectations. And, it was all there: served a nice, cold Arabian mezze, nicely prepared and presented in a transparent design box separated in food sections with a spoon fixed elegantly across the sections. Softdrinks numerous, but surprisingly, cava champagne was served as well as wine, spirits, and beers. Two catering service rounds in 55 minutes is impressive. Staff competent, focused, polite, and extremely efficient. They gave me 3 seats due to my Privilege status at their FFP. Headset, blankets given.

And, in fact, paid the extra money to upgrade to business class when I retired and returned to South Africa with my wife during the pandemic and it was expertly handled and a very satisfying, secure experience. Checked in at Schipol around noon on Tuesday 26 September travelling QR0274 to Doha, then QR1369 to Cape Town on Wednesday 27 September. Checked in three bags, two were received, and one was not. Reported at CPT on arrival on 27 September and a property irregularity report completed with appropriate supporting information including pics. Since then it has been a nightmare of correspondence and communication with various people in CPT, DOHA and AMS. All to NO avail. No one seems to have the capability, willingness or interest in helping a customer retrieve their missing bag containing valued personal possessions, including our family Holy Bible which is irreplaceable. Apparently the missing bag apparently was traced in AMS and was meant to be loaded on QR0274\/29 September to be delivered in CPT on QR1369\/30 September. Nothing arrived and there seems to be complete confusion between CPT and Qatar representatives in Doha and AMS. It seems AMS are not responding but I find it hard to believe that Qatar would not physically investigate what is going on at AMS with their baggage handlers, whom I believe are Swissport. I tried Swissport and the Station Manager in AMS but they don't answer their phones. I keep being assured that the bag is on the next flight but nothing.

On time. Flew on QR award tickets; selected my favourite seats free due to Frequent Flyer status. Quick check ins. Lounge in Hanoi spacious and good. Onboard, menu had 3 choices of hot meal, all announced 10 days prior to departure on QRs homepage. Transfer in Doha smooth with lounge access (Gold Lounge Gate C14). The flights were faultless and excellent for economy class. FAs were energetic, well rested, groomed, and in a sparkling mood. Drinks were generously served throughout the flights, up to 3 drinks per person per round. Food was good with 3 hot options on each sector, though small portions. Further were sandwiches and snacks served and\/or obtainable on request. Both flights were de facto full; this challenges were handled well by the crew who knew how to focus without panicking. IFE worked well with on touch screens, huge supply of movies. Amenity kit and kids toys were given to all who wanted. Decent wines for economy: sparkling was a decent French cr??mant: Veuve Ambal Chardonnay\/Aligot?? (30 usd\/bottle). White wine was acceptable: Frontera Chardonnay 2022, Chile. Red wine was very good: Maison Robert Olivier Syrah, France. Sodas and beer brands were substandard as usual: the cheapest industrial stuff, sells for max. 1-2 USD\/can. Was recognised and further pampered as elite frequent flyer of QR. Only down fall are the very conservative and conform food offerings and the tedious bus-gating in Doha, depriving passengers any premium feeling.

Whilst I sympathise with a passenger, falling ill, of course, a speedier decision would've saved me from missing connections, which we inevitably did. We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was 'less than eight hours' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am 'not a member' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one. The media on the video system did not correspond with the series being advertised i.e., the new series of White Lotus that I was looking forward to watching, whilst being labelled as the latest one set in Sicily, in fact, was the original series which is  a few years old.

Unfortunately both flights were downgraded again, I was informed about the Bangkok to Doha sector 3 days ago, and about the Doha to Zurich sector just 6h before the departure of the flight.  I was up to now willing to pay more, since Qsuites are in high demand and rates were this time around \u00c6\u2019?\u00c2\u00aa350 higher than other configuration.

Good thing I went to NAIA cause I thought its going to rain and it might cause traffic! Started forming our lines at 5:30pm and counters open exactly 5:50pm fir the 11:20pm flight. Check in process was quiet slow, despite my Silver Status I left the counter at 6:40pm. Understandably only two counters were open since the other check in staff are assisting the 6:35pm departure. Anyway, though it was slow but OK since the clerk was super nice and offered me a complimentary lounge pass! The plane departed around 15 minutes later than published but was able to overcome and arrived earlier in Doha! Was a very smooth landing and the crew were all warm! Food served dinner and breakfast were both sumptuous and delicious! I was seated on a window seat and was quiet cramped because the guy beside me was humungous. Arrival in Doha was as expected very warm and pleasant, security check was fast and quick! A separate lounge for Silver members were provided, and was surprised of its huge size, very comfortable, good food, very clean comfort rooms! Went to the gate early as it was quiet far but thanks to the sky train, I was at my gate in seconds! Fortunately, I was upgraded to Business Class on the second leg of the journey! It was a very pleasant experience considering the 13 hours flight to Montreal! Everything went perfectly well!

First announcement: apologies due to technical issues currently being worked on by ground staff. Second announcement: apologies, technical issues now resolved - just carrying out paperwork for clearance. Third announcement: apologies due to technical issues - almost resolved now.  Upon landing in Doha, met by a member of ground staff holding a sign, upon asking if the Manchester flight had departed she said yes. Next flight was in 6 hours - the compensation provided was the equivalent of 10GBP - to spend over the 6 hour wait (a coffee alone was 5GBP). Didn't give access to a lounge. Again, customer service upon receiving the 'compensation' and my next boarding pass was poor - no smile, no apology for the inconvenience. I asked out of curiosity why my bag needed to go through a security check when I'd just come from the plane - the response was that the previous airport flying from could have missed something.

First time flying Q-Suite of Qatar Airline, have heard many good things about it prior to departure which turned out to be exactly as advertised. You get your own spacious suite, comfortable seat, plenty of storage, great food, all are better than other business class experiences that I had. What really went well beyond my expectation was the cabin crew. From the time I boarded they have always been super attentive with prompt service of what I needed. Special Kudo to Amit the supervisor, Hattaya who handled my section with a smile that can light up the cabin, plus Chenny and Asil who both were in the front (Apologies to the rest of the wonderful crew whose names I didn't quite remember) Moreover, the lounge in Doha is just fantastic. There have been plenty of praise about the facilities so I am not going to repeat here. However I really want to point out that all the staffs are well-trained and always proactively helping out asking for our needs, which is not something I experienced in most of the business class lounge. They were also very serious about the work product they delivered. We ordered a steak at the dining room that turned out to be too well-done and not tender, we made a very slight comment about it and five minutes later the Chef came out and explained to us that they deliberately didn't leave it too rare and we are all travelers so they want to be on the safe side. The only drawback is the inflight WIFI. $10 for a full flight plan is very reasonable so I purchased it right on board. However after I napped the system could no longer recognize me so I had to make another purchase.

This was the second sector of a flight from the UK. As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear.

I did have Sapphire lounge access but this is not the same as their business lounges which they reserve exclusively for their full fare paying business class passengers. The planes were full. I mean, literally every seat taken. Considering this, Qatar Airways were outstanding. I have occasionally flown with other airlines on full flights and it can be chaotic, even unpleasant. Not with Qatar whose staff took everything in their stride. The food was excellent for economy class. Would I fly economy again? For two roughly 7-hour legs, probably yes.

The rest is nothing special. Even using my miles I would refrain to use them on 1st unless I had to forego them. Their excellent business class makes 1st class almost superfluous. The product is conservative, amazing space, and care level as the pax desires. QR markets their 1st class as a relish the myriad of exclusive offerings. Business class is similar (better?) and provides better value for the money. A single spoon of Pearl caviar doesn\u00c6\u2019??t make it. The original can was displayed upon request. Sparkling wines in First are expensive, branded Rare and Alexandra (both ex. 2006), but Business has 2 fine champagnes, which are cheaper and good.  The interior of cabin is dull, conservative, with brownish un-inspirational colors. Access to Bar is fine but not only a 1st Class privilege. Tried to preselect food for weeks before flying but it does not work from my departing cities. Could not  access a menu in advance. Lounges, food, space, and service is better than business class. Welcome champagnes on board; given kit and a quality pyjamas. Champagnes served are truly expensive in contrast to the meagre, cheap, industrial sub-quality beers they could offer. Leffe was the least poor. On QR, I have never been able to get an IPA or porter beer. Food not much better than business class, a spoon of Pearl caviar and a deshelled, dry lobster hand does not make the justification nor significant difference.  Had hoped for some outstanding food, but it was close to ordinary. IFE fine big screen. Ground and Luggage: QR has ground handling problems. They refused to relabel my bags to final destination. Staff disregarded QR\u00c6\u2019??s partnership with Rwandair, resulting me to lose my luggage transfer to final destination. Neither QR in Doha nor in BKK were willing to fix it. However, Rwandair fixed it eventually and opted to board me but leaving my bags 2 days behind in Doha before next flight to Kigali. Had to accept. Partnerships with Rwandair has problems of non-aligned systems, separate bookings, BPs not issued reversely, luggage transfer failures, no full lounge access reciprocality. BOOKING Very hard to come around vacant award seats in F, so I had to plan an entire journey around a leg found (BKK-DOH) to accommodate it. Award booking with QR took weeks to book, coordinate, manage, and process. Exacerbated by the fact that my QR booking had to fit into another QR award booking with a partner airline (Rwandair).

Terrible seat pitch. Tiny, faded IFE screens and the dreaded metal box under the seats that takes up half your legroom. And not enough room for carry on luggage if the plane is full. My flight from Doha to Nairobi was packed to the rafters so they were randomly selecting passengers to give up their hand luggage so that it could be put in the hold so as not to overwhelm the overhead bins on board. I had my standard cabin-approved trolley bag which I was told needed to be checked in. I had to remove my electronics and valuables and stuff these in my laptop bag to carry on board. I was given a flimsy zip tie to secure my bag and off it went into the hold. On arrival in Nairobi, it was one of the last bags to make it to the luggage conveyor belt. The flight was a night flight, so I opted to get some sleep rather than wait for dinner. After managing to fall asleep, I was awoken twice to be asked if I wanted to have dinner, which I clearly did not.

The food was all of a high standard - a good selection (usually 3 choices) of meals, and each was tasty and filling. I was very impressed with the alcohol selection - a sparkling wine (rare in economy class), quality red and white wine, two beers, and a small selection of spirits. Most impressive of all was the service: the crew were friendly, attentive, and polite. Drink runs were regular, and staff were engaging and highly professional. On one leg with few passengers, the staff were wonderful - constantly checking up on us, offering more drinks, proactively offering to make a festive cocktail (in economy class!), and ensuring our comfortable.

Flight on time upon two aircraft type changes. Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the flagship among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (Preview Onboard Menu); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline\u00c6\u2019??s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali. I very rarely have had any luggage issues with QR, maybe in 2 flights of 100 \u00c6\u2019?? and in these rare cases, they have done their best to assist me.

Most of the time the staff was excellent. Special mention for Miguel, he took care of us on QR274 on 22 October. This guy goes above and beyond. If you're lucky to have him taking care of your row, you're guaranteed a good flight. Also, Hyeon Jin on QR 273 on 28 October was very very hospitable. So much potential in this girl. Seats on the QSuite were very comfortable. Staff are lovely. All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft).

Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Oct-22","Route":"Mumbai to Budapest via Doha","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":4,"StaffService":4,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":3,"OverallRating":5,"Recommended":"no","cleaned_review":"mumbai to budapest via doha seeing qatar airways consistently wins awards i was eager to experience it after a  year absence unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations the inflight entertainment was not available on the doha to budapest flight the captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem the vegetarian option was a frittata from mumbai to doha and it was ok i award the meal  out of  but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it on the doha to budapest the food was very bland  out of  it was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all it tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower there were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge upon arrival at doha airport it took a full  minutes to open the plane doors this is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the worlds best airport should get its act together on this front the business class passengers who were only  or  passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another  to  minutes despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only the front door the bus taking us to the terminal was extremely cold it was only  degrees celsius in doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to  or  degrees celsius because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took    minutes it feels like qatar airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at qatar airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced. That, and the quality of the food has disappeared since I last travelled and fell in love with Qatar Airways.

It was a night departure from Islamabad. The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA\u00c6\u2019??s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US\/UK\/EU\/China\/South Korea\/AUS\/NZ) But it didn\u00c6\u2019??t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the Final Call 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won\u00c6\u2019??t be using Gatwick again because of its location. And the disturbing passenger had no effect on the excellent hospitality of Qatar Airways.

Boarding process was also very smooth. Even though Heathrow's facilities do not facilitate a smooth boarding process. The flight took off on time, Seats were very comfortable and massive amounts of legroom. The IFE's screens were responsive and easy to use - Meals were a lot better thanks to the new Qcuisine services (I flew Emirates the week before and it was a lot worse). Landed in Doha on-time where I took the opportunity of grabbing myself a dinner and shopping from Qatar Duty Free, (10% off for QTR customers) - The flight to Islamabad was also boarded on time, not as smooth but that is more to be blamed on fellow passengers who do not listen to instructions or even try following them. The flight was quite short. About 2 hours on a new 777. I was sleeping most of the time.

Overall I had two very good long-haul flights with Qatar Airways. On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane.

This was a personal trip. While I have been to US several times over last 17 years - for business as well as personal trips, it was a first trip to US for my son. My son will be pursuing MS at USC in LA and hence he needed extra luggage allowance. My past experience with Qatar is the primary reason I booked our flights with Qatar, though it was not the cheapest option. I wanted to make sure that, even if I had to cancel my travel plan at last minute, my son will have hurdle free journey. However, I was happy that I chose Qatar Airways. Every stage - flight booking, seat & meal selection, check-in, in-flight exp, meals & snacks, in-flight entertainment, baggage handling - was a pleasant experience. Qatar provided extra luggage allowance as student allowance to my son. Qatar also provided full-flight complimentary wi-fi to him as a student offer. We are vegetarians. Almost all airlines have vegetarian meal option but a handful provide good quality and tasty veg meals. Qatar veg meal was excellent. So was their choice of snacks and beverages. Staff was polite and friendly though we were in Economy. I have noticed a stark difference in airline staff behavior when they deal with Business versus Economy class passengers. Even in Economy, their staff was cordial and caring. There were several passengers with variety of queries ranging from meal options to why satellite-based wi-fi was not working at certain times. Staff was answering and helping passengers with genuine interest. A couple of suggestions : 1) Qatar should consider waiving off seat selection fees for middle seats. I had to pay for it as I wanted to make sure I travel together with my son 2) I am not sure if Qatar provides confirmation notification about successful luggage transfer in connecting flights. If they don't then they must consider providing this notification as it will serve as a huge relief for the passengers that their luggage is not left behind.

They did not appear to be fully trained as the usual and past cabin crew have always been, the food was really poor and tasteless. We took advantage of an upgrade offer (QR3900) for our return journey to Doha hoping to enjoy a better quality service upon our return. It proved to be anything but. Firstly the Business Class Lounge catering to Qatar Airways Business Class passengers was closed? We went to other lounges but they were full and would not accept us, eventually we found a lounge that did offer us seats in their reception area. The snack food was truly below par, so too was the extremely poor selection of beverages. We boarded on time and the crew were definitely better and friendlier than our outbound flight, the menu appeared OK but when the food was served it was not up to the Airlines usual standard. I had only a mouthful and could not eat the rest, the chicken that was served to my wife was overcooked and extremely tough.

A350-1000 is one of the most modern planes in operation. The seats were very comfortable despite their thin appearance. There was no tailbone pain during the 15 hour trip from SFO to DOH. There was enough leg room in the first row after business class - Row 16. The best seats on this plane are 31A and 31K as there are no seats in front of them and you get a window too. The next best seats are 17C and 17H, those are aisle seats with no seats in front. Qatar' economy food was pretty good and sufficient.

The resulted in an extremely long layover of 17 hrs 45 mins instead of a planned and bearable 7 hrs 25 mins. It was during the course of downloading the QR App that we noted that the flight timing differs from the timing originally booked. We called Customer Service Hotline immediately to understand the situation and our options. However, we were only told to contact Qatar Airways Customer Care via portal\/email. We lodged our concerns to seek alternative arrangements and or suitable recovery efforts at Doha Airport. To-date we have not heard from QR office despite 2 email reminders. Upon landing at Doha Airport, we approached Qatar Airways Transit Desk to listen to what recovery arrangements have been made for affected passengers. We requested for a \u00c6\u2019??Flight disruption letter\u00c6\u2019?? to facilitate any possible travel insurance claim. The Manager told us that no flight disruption letter will be issued from Doha as the flight disruption had taken place outbound from Singapore. However, this was inconsistent with what passengers were told when the same request was made at the QR check-in counter in Singapore ie. to be provided at DOHA. In relation to our request for accommodation \/ lounge access, the Manager explained that due to COVID reasons, no accommodation nor lounge access could be arranged for affected passengers. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Qatar Airways, the least one would expect is for the airline to mitigate the inconvenience caused through other measures.

It was disappointing that Qatar seems not to re-open its flagship lounge at BKK airport after more than 2 years of closure. Does not make sense to use a very mediocre Miracle lounge since number of flights are back to pre Covid, and airfares about 40% higher in comparison to pre Covid times. Flight was uneventful, food was nothing to shout about. Champagne was uncoiled, red wine was ice cold. I was glad that my flight from Doha was from B2 gate and not the usual bus station like E area. I could not be more wrong. They used an empty airbridge gate and used buses from there. The worst part was to sit in an very hot aircraft with an open door on the tarmac with a very weak aircondition. Generally, Doha Airport has lost its advantage over other airports and is the weakest part of the overall experience while flying Qatar. The flight to Warsaw was good, with better service and food in comparison to my first leg of the journey. There are no more amenity kits for Doha to Europe flights. When I asked about it, I was told that there are no more kits for flights below 6h. Both of my flights were 5.5h; but the BKK to Doha sector had a lovely amenity kit. Overall ok flights, but Qatar lacks consistency, and the ground services in Doha are getting worse.

When we arrived at Heathrow we were informed our flight had only just departed Doha due to technical difficulties, which meant a 7 hour delay at the airport with 2 young children. We were offered a ?\u00c5\u201c40 voucher for the whole family for food and refreshments. We effectively lost a day of our holiday. When we booked our tickets, we ensured we selected flights which had a brief (< 2 hour) stopover in Doha and we paid a premium compared to options with a far longer stopover. Shortly before our holiday we received a notification of a change of flights which meant we now had a 6 hour stopover in Doha for the return journey - something we had wanted to avoid with our 2 young children. I contacted Qatar by telephone (no easy task) to request an alternative flight but this was not possible and no explanation was given for the change. On arrival in Doha, the Qatar Airways transfer staff were unhelpful and not interested in providing us with any lounge access to allow our children to rest (we were in Doha airport from 10pm to 4am local time). We tried numerous lounges at Hamad International Aiport and were willing to pay for access but nobody was able to help us.  We tried to reserve premium seats on some of the flights via the Qatar app, but each time we were unable to complete the additional payment. I contacted Qatar by telephone to reserve our seats but was told I was not able to do this because I booked through an agent (Expedia). I contacted Expedia and was told I needed to contact the airline to reserve \u00c6\u2019??preferred\u00c6\u2019?? seats. I contacted Qatar once more and spoke to a different associate who advised me that I could indeed reserve these seats after all.

Yet having changed the first outward plane from the original booking 4 months earlier, my seat was changed from 2K to 10K. Although QR had my phone and email, at no time did the airline attempt to contact me. At the airport I refused to sit in the second cabin. It was only thanks to a member of the ground staff who persuaded someone in 3K to change with me. The lounge at BKK was not the Qatar Airways lounge but the miserable Miracle lounge. The flights themselves were vastly better with one exception. The seats are extremely comfortable and sleeping is relatively easy. The 777 and A350 had the Q suites. I enjoy these on the 777 but the cabin feels quite cramped on the A350. Meals were excellent but the movie selection was boring and seemed geared more to children. The one exception was departing EDI. With the cabin crew arriving late, we had to stand in line for about 25 minutes before boarding started. The three wheelchair passengers were naturally allowed priority. A few minutes later business class was boarded but with the wheelchairs  still at the end of the airbridge we had to wait another 20 minutes or so before they could be boarded. I looked forward to a hot towel and a glass of rose champagne. Quickly other passengers were being served while no FA bothered to take my coat. I finally had to ask to be served, being the last in the cabin to receive any attention.

{"_id":"66b85f58c4a8d6813c87de1f","Title":"The IFE is world class","Name":"Anders Pedersen","ReviewDate":"5\/3\/2022","Airline":"Qatar Airways","Verified":"TRUE","Reviews":"  Flew 1st March 2022 on brand new aircrafts, B787-9 and A350-1000, respectively. Flights on time. Ticket purchase, upgrade by miles (2nd leg), ground services, ticket changes went smooth. I had to change a simple economy ticket 4 times. Only once I was charged additional (minimal charge). Check-in in CPH easy and quick getting all 3 boarding passes at once. This, despite I faced steep documentation requirements for final destination beyond Singapore to Papua New Guinea. Their cooperation with partner Air Niugini was perfectly coordinated and a relief. QR respect their elite members on ground as well as on board \u00c6\u2019?? for this trip there were no let-downs or real issues \u00c6\u2019?? their call centre was excellent, decisional, and cooperative. Lounge experiences: QR uses now the Eventyr Lounge in CPH which is a great improvement compared to the lounges they earlier used. Further, it is situated in non-Schengen area 3 Minutes from boarding gate. The Eventyr lounge is good, likely the best in Copenhagen - but it is still below world class. The best is the views, service, showers, and draught beer presence. Hot food only provides 1 dish while cold sandwiches are more diverse. No champagne and poor wines. They should open the balcony area to reduce greenhouse heating effect of the panorama windows which dominates the entire lounge. In Doha, the Al Mourjan Lounge is back to previous (pre-Corona) standards \u00c6\u2019?? lack of beer options are the biggest shortcoming. Good showers and very good relax\/working options. CPH-DOH: I was given an exit seat but opted to take the only full seat section available next to the toilets so I could spread out with my things. Free WiFi for 1 hour granted, it worked well. Stewardess(es) were of high quality. Food good and are improving compared to just a few months ago. Sparkling wine (cava) offered in economy. The 2 wines were good. The new beers to replace the Heineken do not really provide improvements as they are also very dull, industrial lagers (Budwiser and Stella Artois). Arrived in Doha well pampered and in a splendid mood. DOH-SIN (night-flight) in business: Embarking in Doha at a remote gate by busses is a bad first impression for a business class ride. The Q-suites in business class are in my view completely overrated. These micro-cabins deprive passengers contact, air and view. Window access poor from those seats forward directed. If one sits backwards oriented, the window access is perfect but the direction is awkward to me. Seats and beds were excellent. The IFE is world class with updated movies, huge selection options, and the best I have ever encountered. Huge soft touch monitors. Smooth travel, reliable airline, flights on time. FAs excellent, 2 kinds: well-trained caretakers and less trained food-bringers. High class dining though without true dinner. The food was good but just light, cold dinner snacks. Cold lobster bites dont quite make it. Breakfast better, but merely neatly looking and served than actually tasty. Coffee and tea truly homemade and of high class. Drinks were World-class: 2 champagnes and 6 wines offered \u00c6\u2019?? all expensive and of high quality. Bollinger 2006 rose champagne was very tasty and sparkling one of the best I have had for long. One quality beer, Leffe Blonde, was outstanding. Pyjamas and Amenity kit given out.","TypeofTraveller":"Business","MonthFlown":"Mar-22","Route":"Copenhagen to Singapore via Doha","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":1,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":5,"OverallRating":9,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"flew st march  on brand new aircrafts b and a respectively flights on time ticket purchase upgrade by miles nd leg ground services ticket changes went smooth i had to change a simple economy ticket  times only once i was charged additional minimal charge checkin in cph easy and quick getting all  boarding passes at once this despite i faced steep documentation requirements for final destination beyond singapore to papua new guinea their cooperation with partner air niugini was perfectly coordinated and a relief qr respect their elite members on ground as well as on board  for this trip there were no letdowns or real issues  their call centre was excellent decisional and cooperative lounge experiences qr uses now the eventyr lounge in cph which is a great improvement compared to the lounges they earlier used further it is situated in nonschengen area  minutes from boarding gate the eventyr lounge is good likely the best in copenhagen  but it is still below world class the best is the views service showers and draught beer presence hot food only provides  dish while cold sandwiches are more diverse no champagne and poor wines they should open the balcony area to reduce greenhouse heating effect of the panorama windows which dominates the entire lounge in doha the al mourjan lounge is back to previous precorona standards  lack of beer options are the biggest shortcoming good showers and very good relaxworking options cphdoh i was given an exit seat but opted to take the only full seat section available next to the toilets so i could spread out with my things free wifi for  hour granted it worked well stewardesses were of high quality food good and are improving compared to just a few months ago sparkling wine cava offered in economy the  wines were good the new beers to replace the heineken do not really provide improvements as they are also very dull industrial lagers budwiser and stella artois arrived in doha well pampered and in a splendid mood dohsin nightflight in business embarking in doha at a remote gate by busses is a bad first impression for a business class ride the qsuites in business class are in my view completely overrated these microcabins deprive passengers contact air and view window access poor from those seats forward directed if one sits backwards oriented the window access is perfect but the direction is awkward to me seats and beds were excellent the ife is world class with updated movies huge selection options and the best i have ever encountered huge soft touch monitors smooth travel reliable airline flights on time fas excellent  kinds welltrained caretakers and less trained foodbringers high class dining though without true dinner the food was good but just light cold dinner snacks cold lobster bites dont quite make it breakfast better but merely neatly looking and served than actually tasty coffee and tea truly homemade and of high class drinks were worldclass  champagnes and  wines offered  all expensive and of high quality bollinger  rose champagne was very tasty and sparkling one of the best i have had for long one quality beer leffe blonde was outstanding pyjamas and amenity kit given out","polarity":0.0,"complaints":"no"}

I purchased extra legroom in the emergency exit row. When I reached my seat during boarding there was the pillow, blanket, amenity kit, and headphones on my seat. I set them down next to my seat on the floor, as there was no where else where I could have access to them while seated. For take off procedures the flight attendant grabbed all of the items and put them into the overhead storage bin away from my seat. When I was able to get up, I could not even locate all of the items. My food was average at best and staff took so long to collect the used meal trays that passengers were bringing their trays to the staff workstation. My one beef with the entertainment system was that they played the same airline\/airport commercial every time you watched a new show. When time my flight arrived in Doha we had to exit using stairs and board a shuttle to reach the terminal. And with all of the other COVID rules on masks and cleaning, why would you pack in passengers on a shuttle bus until it is very full. I sent a fairly comprehensive email to Qatar Airways that highlighted my disappointment, received an automated reply from the airline nearly two weeks ago acknowledging receipt of my email but I have heard nothing back since. Perhaps it is the highly rated business class product that is generating the rave reviews. But as for us coach passengers, I don\u00c6\u2019??t understand how this airline could be number one.

Air Canada's ridiculousness almost caused me to miss my connecting flight to Qatar, but the stress that could have caused me was completely alleviated by Qatar's staff assuring me that any cancellation prior to take off would receive a full refund directly to the method of payment. This generous policy during COVID times really made me very thankful and they deserve praise for it. That bumps up the review overall though, because the in air experience is not great. The on ground experience is perfect, with great boarding, great staff support, great call support, great privilege club benefits and so on. But in the air, I was greeted with an oldish plane and subpar seating. The seats were somehow smaller than even I've become accustomed to in recent years. The entertainment system was alright but slightly laggy, and the headphones provided were awful. The food was of acceptable quality, though the lunch provided between the two meals was subpar (it was a boring, bland roll.) The wifi is only 10 dollars but privilege club members get one hour for free. I believe students get it for free in general but I wasn't able to get that to work.

Onboard Qsuite is ok, lacks the little touches of other Middle East carriers such as Emirates; dine on demand was a no for me, drinks glasses are collected but I was not asked if a refill On arrival in Doha it was a dash to the lounge to grab a shower, but refused entry to the business lounge as the flight was due for boarding in 20 minutes. So off we go to the gate, 1 hour later still sat there and flight again late. Crew ask what you want for breakfast at this stage it\u00c6\u2019??s was 8 hours away. I asked can I order after take off, no was the answer as limited food on board. Arrive in Cape Town to be meet at the gate  sorry u have no bags, go to lost luggage and fill out a form. 1st 2 days of the break trying to find out where the bags are, had to go buy essentials and clothes. After 36 hours bags arrived, no compensation. Day 6 we receive a schedule change for the departure is pushed back a day, day 9 another email to say the flight has been cancelled due to operational reasons and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. You can benefit from the flexible re-booking policy and change your travel date or destination free of charge within the same booking class (fare difference will apply), or request a refund for the value of your ticket to the original form of payment with no penalties or refund fees.

They right away informed me via app notification, email, and a phone call (following day business hour). It really put my mind at ease. They changed to an aircraft fitted with Q suite, which is like flying first class. Due to the delay, business class cabin was quite full, but it didn't affect the high level of service. Welcome drinks, pyjama sets, toiletry bag and all. Due to the pandemic, there was no magazines or any reading materials. However, there were printed menu and wine list. Crew wear a face mask. Food was served course by course in generous portion, there was no signs of any cost cutting. Inflight wifi was fast and steady too, only cost USD10 for the entire flight. Qsuite is one of the very best business class seats in the current market. The door gives you an excellent level of privacy. Comfortable large seat with sufficient storage space and comfortable for sleeping position. Throughout the flight crew presence is good, very pro active, they always come around and see if anyone needs a drink or so. A truly wonderful 9 hours just flew by, a very smooth landing.

The seats are comfy, the legroom in the economy is okay (but for long flights, if you have money better to take a business class). In addition to the standard kit - pillow + blanket - they gave protective kits on both flights and amenity kit on a long flight (that was actually very useful for me since I always forget my eye mask and earplugs).

Check-In in Kigali easy, though must be in Airport 4 hours prior to departure due to Corona prevention measures. Granted Lounge access to Pearl lounge which is acceptable. Must pay for luxury beverages. But a variety of hot food and snacks offered makes up for it. All flights on B-787-8. Long haul Economy Class QR is top notch and matches economy+ on other airlines. They have improved economy class services since I travelled with them last time; 18 months ago. FAs are attentive and extremely concerned of elite travellers like myself \u00c6\u2019?? I have a fainting Gold Card, but was addressed by name throughout I was given the best seats possible in economy among options provided. Drinks were offered frequently. Call bells responded to quickly. Three choices of hot food on every long leg: plenty of it, and I got more if requested. No seafood, mutton, fish or exotic meat offered. English breakfast without bacon? Salads average and desserts were excellent. Sparkling wine (Cava) and wines. Beers offered are still embarrassing: only two, similar, dull lagers offered: Stella Artois and Budweiser \u00c6\u2019?? Heineken has gone but that does not add to the repertoire, anyway. The leg DOH-CPH offered two meal rounds. First, a Champagne brunch (3 meal options). Then, a heavy sandwich prior to descend. I was given 3 seats through seat-block for elite travellers. FFP-lounges in Doha are temporarily upgraded to become the Al Mourjan - even for economy travelers with card status. In CPH my luggage came out as the first. A pleasant travel.

I flew in Economy class and they offered me a small amenity kit and a hygiene kit. Even during the pandemic, Qatar Airways offers cold refreshing wipes which is a really good touch. The seats offer lot of legroom however you can always pay extra and get an emergency exit seat . The IFE is good,  its latest, however I would love to see more variety. The inflight meals were really good, I had three options to choose from both of my flights. On the Boston- Doha, they served 4 meals consisting of dinner, 2 hot snacks and 1 breakfast. The crew was really nice and friendly, they made sure everyone had a good time. Qatar airways also offers wifi where for 60 minutes every passenger gets it for free and if you want for your whole journey, you can pay 10$ which is a pretty cheap deal compared to Emirates that charges more. The wifi is so fast that you can do video calls as well.

We are glad that we chose Qatar Airways who made us feel safe and relieved. Transfer desk staff at Montreal were friendly and helpful in sorting out some last minute challenges on travel clearance. They gave us a meal voucher since all business class lounges were closed in Montreal airport. Boarding was streamlined to ensure social distance. Upon boarding the crew introduced and explained the cabin features. The amenity kid, COVID PPE kit, duvet were all ready at the seat and the crew offered the pyjamas. We chose the refreshing lemon mint signature drink prior to take off. The Qsuite is truly a first class business class suite with great comfort and privacy, could not ask for anything more. The couple suite rear facing was great offering us more personal space with the divider removed. The beverage and meal service was prompt and on demand. We miss the trolley service where you get to choose the options and appreciate the presentation but that is understandable during COVID times. One of the cabin crew was convincing my wife hard to have the breakfast since she skipped the dinner service. The crew wear their full PPE including gown and safety glasses and the passengers are required to wear masks at all times. The washrooms were kept clean at all times, however I felt the A350 washrooms bit smaller than the B777 ones. The transit experience in Hamad airport was smooth and refreshing. The 3 hours went by quick with shower facilities, spacious seating options and dining options on the upper level.

Boarding the aircraft at Bangkok was the most professional and well controlled that I have ever experienced at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport; whereas they normally descend into chaos as soon as boarding is announced. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the modernity and cleanliness of the aircraft that we boarded, everything we needed for the flight, e.g. facemasks, hand cleanser, ear plugs etc were all neatly arranged in the seat pockets in front of us. The cabin crew were very smartly dressed and neatly turned out, and they were very polite, attentive and visibly present throughout the whole flight. The in-flight meals were of the very highest standard, and probably the best that I have ever been served on a flight back to the London. We arrived in Doha on schedule, and boarded flight at the correct time and the boarding was conducted with the same proficient manner as out first flight. The London bound plane was absolutely jammed pack, but the cabin crew, although extremely busy, behaved with the same quiet and firm professionalism that I had experienced throughout. I witnessed an incident whereby a passenger removed his facemask and refused to put it back on, this passenger was immediately dealt with in a very firm and thoroughly professional manner, which was very reassuring for other passengers around.

Travelling on Qatar Airways recently was a stress free, COVID safe, comfortable experience from start to finish. The check in process wasn't perfect, but with all the changes to legislation of various countries, I did expect things to be a little slower. This in my opinion is acceptable in the current climate. When on the flight, there were plenty of seats available to maintain some form of social distance, the crew wore correct PPE and enforced passengers to do the same. The crew issue a travel pack which contained sufficient face masks, gloves and hand sanitiser for the trip and onward journey. Food on the flight was tasty and the drinks service was sufficient to remain comfortable through out the trip. On arrival at Doha, all passengers was ushered through to transfers, by passing the unnecessary security check points allowing us to, again maintain social distancing. I had a long layover so utilised an airport lounge but I did noticed the majority of the stores open in Doha Airport. My trip involved two flights which both arrived on time at their respective destinations. Overall, I was very impressed how COVID safe and comfortable the journey was, and that is travelling economy.

We'd not flown business before so we thought we would treat ourselves, our bookings were made well in advance pre-Covid. Due to the restrictions on flying our flight got pushed back until we finally got clearance to fly one year after our initial booking and six months after our intended flight. Changing our tickets was simplicity and the person dealing with the change was very helpful. Checking in at Sydney was average with the check in staff doubling up with gate duties, there were only four flights departing Sydney that evening so they weren't exactly rushed off their feet. The flight was uneventful which is how you want it. The service was exemplary, very attentive and the food was delicious with plenty of it. The seat although lie flat wasn't as comfortable as I was expecting and on the 14 hour flight I got somewhere between 2-3 hours of sleep. The in flight entertainment was average with few major movies available. We had three hours at Doha before catching our onward flight to Heathrow and we used most of the three hours in the spacious lounge refreshing ourselves. The onward flight was a repeat of the first flight, generally pleasant with the same caveats as before. Overall the onboard experience was very good. But what marred the flight was after we got to our isolation destination to find out an expensive electrical item had been badly damaged despite it being marked as fragile. Qatar's response was effectively 'tough, that's the terms of service that we had signed up for' and they declined to take responsibility or consider my claim for damages.

There is currently a promotion active which lets you earn many bonus miles - so I contacted Qatar if I will be able to collect these miles. The answer was no. You booked this flight with a voucher from an earlier, cancelled flight, so I am not eligible for the current promo.

Given the current situation, I felt at ease as all passengers were required to wear both face masks and a face shield. Temperature checks were also require prior to boarding. Qatar Airways seems to be taking the pandemic very seriously, which is great to see, as they supplied us with spare masks, gloves and hand sanitiser, all complimentary. Frustratingly, the screens at London Heathrow stated flight closing when the flight hadn\u00c6\u2019??t even started boarding yet, and this caused a number of passengers to panic considering the huge size of Terminal 5 and the amount of time it can take to cross the terminal to get to your gate. I was very surprised with how spacious the aircraft was. There was plenty of leg room and it was great to see Qatar Airways adhere to social distancing regulations - no two passengers were seated next to one another unless travelling as a group. The meal services provided onboard were fantastic. They had more selection than other airlines I\u00c6\u2019??ve flown with in the past. Cabin crew were generally very welcoming and friendly. My connection in Doha was only 1 hour, however this was plenty of time for me and my bags to make it to the other aircraft in time. Overall a great experience - if you\u00c6\u2019??re nervous about flying during the current pandemic, I would highly recommend considering Qatar Airways as their Covid-19 rules and regulations put me at ease and it was great to see them taking the safety of passengers and crew seriously.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Oct-20","Route":"London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon via Doha","Class":"Economy Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":5,"FoodnBeverages":5,"InflightEntertainment":4,"ValueForMoney":5,"OverallRating":9,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"generally had a pleasant experience flying with qatar airways given the current situation i felt at ease as all passengers were required to wear both face masks and a face shield temperature checks were also require prior to boarding qatar airways seems to be taking the pandemic very seriously which is great to see as they supplied us with spare masks gloves and hand sanitiser all complimentary frustratingly the screens at london heathrow stated flight closing when the flight hadnt even started boarding yet and this caused a number of passengers to panic considering the huge size of terminal  and the amount of time it can take to cross the terminal to get to your gate i was very surprised with how spacious the aircraft was there was plenty of leg room and it was great to see qatar airways adhere to social distancing regulations  no two passengers were seated next to one another unless travelling as a group the meal services provided onboard were fantastic they had more selection than other airlines ive flown with in the past cabin crew were generally very welcoming and friendly my connection in doha was only  hour however this was plenty of time for me and my bags to make it to the other aircraft in time overall a great experience  if youre nervous about flying during the current pandemic i would highly recommend considering qatar airways as their covid rules and regulations put me at ease and it was great to see them taking the safety of passengers and crew seriously","polarity":0.7333333333,"complaints":"no"}

We received a confirmation email from them with our eticket's. I tried to contact Qatar Airways via phone at their listed airport number for two weeks to inquire and add our pet to our reservation.  Also tried reaching out on their facebook page but still no answer. We ended up leaving our pet behind. Upon arriving at the airport, the agent informed me that my husband's credit card should be present for verification. I told them that I had the same credit card with the same account number\/credit card number because we share the same account but my card is under my name. They refused it and were about to send me back home. The supervisor informed me that an email was sent to us for credit card verification. I informed them that I did not get such an email. I contacted my husband who was in the US and he also did not get an email. I quickly searched my junk mail and found that it was sent to me the day before the flight. I sat in the airport and submitted all required documents online (luckily I had all what they required available). We waited for QA customer support to verify but they did not. They tried to call them from the airport but they did not answer and they did not even reply to the emails they were sending. The supervisor then told me that the only option left was for me to put down another payment and once they finish the credit card verification, then they'd refund me. I used the same credit card and we were on our way. At Doha airport (transit) I seemed to remember leaving behind my expensive headphones hanging on the hand of my seat. I immediately asked a QA agent to have a staff member get it for me since i was not allowed back onto the plane. The agent called the lost and found office instead and got no answer. He assured me that they'd send it for me once found. I told him that I was still here at the airport and it would be quick to just get it now, he did not seem able to help. At Los Angeles airport, they seemed to have lost one of my luggage. The agents there assured me that all luggages were transferred and were onboard and another customer has grabbed my bag. I filed a missing bag form and they called me the next day to inform me that it was found. Upon inquiring where the bag was at, the agent told me that it was left behind in Beirut airport. Once I got home, I checked my credit card and found that the two charges for our airline tickets were both cleared. I emails customer support and until this moment did not receive my refund. I had to file a dispute with my credit card and since I had all proof that I was double charged, my credit card has immediately refunded my money back. They found my headphones and I have to drive to nearest airport to get them.

The whole experience was wonderful, the Qsuite was perfect. The bed was extremely comfortable, the food was delicious and I ended up having a reasonable sleep on the plane. The crew were amazing, very helpful and professional. The second flight from Doha to London was even better. The crew were very helpful with just the right amount of attentiveness. The plane was spotlessly clean and the PPE worn by the staff was good. They managed to be pleasant and cheerful even when wearing PPE, they were a real credit to the company. The food service was good and the food itself was very tasty. The crew noticed when I was awake and offered tea\/coffee. I watched several movies, and there was a wide choice on the IFE. It was a long journey (26 hours with layovers) and I arrived in London feeling well rested and very pleased that I had chosen to fly with Qatar. I would highly recommend Qatar Airways.","TypeofTraveller":"Solo Leisure","MonthFlown":"Jul-20","Route":"Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha","Class":"Business Class","SeatComfort":5,"StaffService":3,"FoodnBeverages":4,"InflightEntertainment":3,"ValueForMoney":5,"OverallRating":10,"Recommended":"yes","cleaned_review":"what a wonderful company in kl airport we were given face shields to protect ourselves in the lounge and during boardingthey were not uncomfortable and definitely made me feel more secure whilst travelling i had been living in a covid free country and was a little concerned about being exposed the use of masks shields and ppe by the staff really helped me feel safer the whole experience was wonderful the qsuite was perfect the bed was extremely comfortable the food was delicious and i ended up having a reasonable sleep on the plane the crew were amazing very helpful and professional the second flight from doha to london was even better the crew were very helpful with just the right amount of attentiveness the plane was spotlessly clean and the ppe worn by the staff was good they managed to be pleasant and cheerful even when wearing ppe they were a real credit to the company the food service was good and the food itself was very tasty the crew noticed when i was awake and offered teacoffee i watched several movies and there was a wide choice on the ife it was a long journey  hours with layovers and i arrived in london feeling well rested and very pleased that i had chosen to fly with qatar i would highly recommend qatar airways","polarity":0.16,"complaints":"no"}

I wasn't comfortable with that especially during covid so booked and paid for a rather expensive accompanied and assist while transiting through. They took her to a lounge and left her there and someone else came later to assist her to flight, no real issues. I realised while checking in on the way back to the UK that the accompanied on the ticket didn't include the return leg which I asked for and assumed with the price paid was completed. We checked at the desk and said he'd sorted it out and all was arranged. She landed in Qatar and was told by the staff on the plane to speak to the staff as she got off which she did.

While the plane was near empty and the cabin crew wore full PPE, they were really the only indications that we're in the midst of a global pandemic. Food and drink offering were top notch and the QSuite is possibly the best business class product available. The cabin crew were as engaging and hospitable as ever despite the limitations of working in full PPE - they really wanted to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying the flight. Hamad International Airport was empty as was the Al Mourjan Business Lounge so our seven hour transit was a breeze.
